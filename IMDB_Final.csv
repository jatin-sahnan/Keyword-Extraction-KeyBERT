drmayurc,7 November 2022,Reality of medical services,"Shown exact situation of medical services at cutt off areas from mainland. Superb movie. Great acting with best screenplay and editing works. Each and every section is very well handled by director and producer. Story of rural India medical facilities regarding how is the reality despite of government policies and schemes which ignored always. Well handled topic which usually not disscus in the real Life. How much doctor can do for people and how much he couldn't do due to his hand tied by the situation he faces due to lack of facilities by government of India. How people get affected by the crisis and medical services.

sumanmohanty-09208,6 November 2022,A masterpiece.The best odia movie.One of the best movies ever made.,"The best Odia movie. One of the best movies till now.1st tym after 5 yrs 60% seats were filled for an Odia movie in a multiplex. Can't believe a child sitting besides me scolded his disturbing father to concentrate on the movie .At the climax he stood up & said I will be a doctor definitely. Kudos to Devi Prasad Lenka & Vishal Mourya for giving this extraordinary movie to us. This movie is a tight slap to the cuttack based so called Ollywood film makers. They should retire & give works to these kind of new. Creative filmmakers . The duos Mumbai movie making skills clearly visible on the screen. Probably this will remain BabushanMohanty & 2nd lead named Ravi's best & memorable film.Really disappointing Babhushan u hv bn wasting ur god gifted talent by doing nonsense ,joker ,idiotic movies till now in the name of commercial cinema. Babushan u hv rotten urself. U must give us such extraordinary new kind of movies not the cheap Ashok Pati movies.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

ajitrajuraju,8 November 2022,#DAMAN A Must watch,"I feel overwhelmed by the movie, such a movie beautiful movie with facts. This is the best way to put social issue what common people face day today life. Many people across Odisha can relate this movie with their real life issue, they face with medical facility, health care issue, Govt reach and lots more. This is common across the country, most of the state goes through this issue every year. I urge the Director, producer to release it in other languages as well and give it a national image.This movie shows that Odia industry do have talent, potential and ability to think, deliver big content.I wish for such movies to come.

pradhansunil-75942,7 November 2022,Epic with Masterpiece,"Seriously it's been a long time since any odia film put out the strength of the actual film. DAMaN showing the artificial picture to grab the audience to theatre. Every minutes of the scenes have a gratitude level performance. Cinematography, Content, Location along with screenplay deserve a lot of applause. For the first time in the theatre of Odisha, Audience stand and cheers in the climaxxx scene. It is coming with emotional attachment,Love ,care and understanding the naturalism. DAMaN is originally a biography movie about a doctor who appears to be a lot of problems when a cut-off area people are not able to get a basic level of treatment. Go watch and feel the theme of DAMaN.....

newgamrit,4 November 2022,Masterpiece of odia cinema,"Cinematography, locations, direction, acting is awsome. You will live the entire movie with lot of emotions, heart touching scenes. Kudos to entire team and hope for blockbuster. You can't imagine such locations is existing within odisha. Culture of odisha tribes is presented in well manner and it require pan india release.Request every odia people to atleast see this movie once in nearby theaters, believe me you won't regret. This type of original story should be made in future and cinema halls should give more screen and support this kind of cinema. I hardly watch odia cinema in movie hall but this one i bought ticket in last moment and realise that ""Odisha- India's best kept secret""

soumyaranjanmechanical,6 November 2022,A movie demolishing every possible cliche existing in Odia cinema,"To be Frank for every Odia movie lover, a good odia movie was just a gone day reality. I truly never thought in this life I will get an opportunity to say to the world that ""Look, this is our Odia movie.""
Fortunately, Daman has demolished all my delusions.The story, the direction, the screenplay, the dialogues are just perfect. However, the music of Gourav Anand impressed the most. Dhemsa, Nichhatia Mana, Ekela Chale, Daman, all four songs are the four rays of hope for the world of Odia music. They will be in every odia soothing playlist sooner or later.Babushan is playing the lead role perfectly. No one else could be imagined in the role of Doctor Siddharth Mahanty. However, it is deepanwit who has really showcased what a able actor can add to the script. He has truly kept the audience hooked till the end. Not just these two, the truth is, all the actors, in big and small role, have performed wonderfully.Odia Cinema in the recent years have been facing heavy criticism due to lack of originality. To all those critics, it's my humble request to show some love and support now. This movie truly deserve your blessings.",10/10,Daman
yagneshpraharaj,6 November 2022,Awesome,"All of you go and watch first time odisha own contain movie based on true story.#support odia movie like this movie.inspiring movie and acting of doctor babusan was great with all I will say just go and then say this is not a copy movie..Like other movies so pls go with your family this movie is also very inspiring for kids .So request as a odia protect your culture and go watch the movie in this movie all the odia cultures are shown acting direction was very perfectly done. You will not feel boaring and after interval the story will be more exciting upto interval you will not leave your place and you will have the curiosity to know after interval what story will be.

sunilsethy-35839,8 November 2022,A budget master piece!!!,"Everything in this film are up to the mark sheher it is screen play, Music, story line, direction. Both Babushaan and Dipanweet are very talented and natural actors in this film they did their best to the character they have played. All the artist in this film did really good and one thing that make this movie special is each and every cast did very natural and perfect acting.Director did excellent job in this film and his vision is next level. One thing is clear that content is important for that we don't need huge budget or item song and all.I hope there will be more realistic films like Daman.

subhashispraharaj,10 November 2022,Learning for Odia Industry,"It's a excellent movie to watch. Current generation love this kind of movies. The key heighlights are true story giving a strong message to society. This is not only a story of odisha but also a mirror to every society. This is not a kind of typical commercial movies with family drama and romance. The direction is also very much simple and narrative. Everyone should watch this kind of movies at least once. Everyone should feel the real pain in the cut off areas. The role of doctors to the society beautifully explained here. So this movie should be an inspiration to all the young doctors to at least serve for this kind of people.Thank you.

sahubapun,6 November 2022,Masterpiece story with mind-blowing direction and realistic acting,"After a long time, the movie Daman helped to save the odia industry through it's realistic storyline and representative the beauty of Odisha. The odia industry need this kind of movie to compete with other industries instead of copying. Odia movie industry is one of the oldest movie industry. Due to copying from others, it was not growing as it was in 90s. Do support this movie, I watched a odia movie after 7 years and always preferred to watch south indian movies but this time everything changed. I found my culture, natural beauty and a lot of things through this movie. Thanks to all the Daman team for bringing such a great movie. Lots of love from my heart.

cuteraaz-60186,11 November 2022,Excellent movie. Masterpiece.,"After a long time, the movie Daman helped to save the odia industry through it's realistic storyline and representative the beauty of Odisha. The odia industry need this kind of movie to compete with other industries instead of copying. Odia movie industry is one of the oldest movie industry. Due to copying from others, it was not growing as it was in 90s. Do support this movie, I watched a odia movie after 7 years and always preferred to watch south indian movies but this time everything changed. I found my culture, natural beauty and a lot of things through this movie. Thanks to all the Daman team for bringing such a great movie. Lots of love from my heart.Love you daman crew members.

jaganmohanmohapatro,4 November 2022,Must watch movie. Turning point in Ollywood filmmaking.,"The film was very engaging. Enjoyed each and every moment. Got goose bumps in many scenes. The cinematography was upto the mark and the direction is cool. The acting of the star cast is upto the mark. The story line is based on the real life incident of a doctor and the struggle of people in backward districts of odisha due to lack of basic health amenities. And How a doctor fights against it It's a must watch movie. Hope this movie will attract a large mass to the halls. And it would be a success to an another level. The movie progression was also quiet interesting. The background music the songs were all in sync.

I will be honestly speaking it's a spectacular masterpiece focussing on our rural rooted culture and the problems that people face which are not even addressed or even proper attention is not paid. Ignorance of anything is truly dangerous. Beautifully depicted a true responsibility of a doctor fighting to its skin to eradicate Malaria in a tribal rural area of Odisha.Extremely happy the way story line is narrated. The screenplay is always binding through out of the movie. The lead actor Babushan Playing Dr. Siddharth beautifully lived his Character and so as other protagonists.

No nonsense scenes, no copy cat of South India movie, no useless item numbers, no useless aaee, oyee and under the belt comedy. This should be the beginning of new era for odia movies. I just want to give a tight hug to the director and the complete team. The location and the songs are so beautiful. When the movie was over everyone was clapping in the theatre, it shows how the movie is being liked by everyone. It's a complete family movie. My suggestion to team Daman is to release it in other languages as well. Kudos again and a must watch.

bunnymohanty,7 November 2022,Daman one of the best movie ever made in odisha.,"Daman is one of the best movie ever made in odia and in an unique possible way also. I personally loved the movie but there were some parts which made me not liking them.Things that made me fall in love : the characters, comic dialogues and timing, the way they portrayed some scenes, the scenic views of koraput and how beautifully they have merged those with storytelling.Things I didn't like :
Sound design and mix, background score could have been used intelligently, using of jump shots wasn't going well at some part and most importantly I felt it needed bit more detailings in the story...

chand-suhas,24 November 2022,A good doctor will cure the disease but a great doctor will cure the patient.,"DAMaN is about the battle against mosquitoes to eradicate malaria in the 151 villages at the cut off area where the basic amenities too aren't provided to these tribal people. It is about one doctor's efforts to unify multiple department to successfully execute the mission to save lives from malaria. However, this main plot itself is reserved for the last 40mins of the movie.What works for the movie is it's novel story (based on true events) and how well the nativity is projected on screen. The narrative sticks to the basics of film making and the entire first half though doesn't give out anything new, still delivers due to the performances and the setting. The short runtime works well for the movie and when the movie started to feel repetitive, the main plot began which elevated the screenplay.This was my first Odia movie in theater and I am glad to have checked this out.",6/10,Daman

guglu-17471,5 November 2022,Surprised to see a such a movie in Odia.,"Good movie. A great attempt by the Directors of the film. Many thanks to all the Crew members who together working made the movie a Must watch. Finally a great shout out to the producers who really believed and tried to make such an Odia movie which shows a place in our state so called CUT OFF area of Malkangiri district, a place where there is no connectivity, no roads, no means of communication, no hospitals. It's like a place which is completely out of our world and it shows how the people live and survive without proper facilities, medications and live in disbeliefs and how a man's determination helped the people to overcome their problems. One should definitely watch this movie especially the doctors I would say as it will surely inspire them to do something for the mankind by not thinking about only about self . If only a single person's will power made such a thing possible which is near to impossible then each one has the same responsibility to do this. Lastly a huge shout out to Babushaan Mohanty for his acting. It was superb and loved to see Babushaan in a complete new avatarüôÇ.

ajitofficial-45651,12 November 2022,Daman is a must watch movie.,"Daman is a must watch movie. This is a fantastic movie. The way movie is going is marvelous. Such a heart touching story. This is based on a true event. In this movie content is king. Here no unnecessary item songs, vulgarity. We can watch this movie with our whole family. This is a revolution from Odia industry which is very small industry. Outside Odisha no one even heard about odia industry. This is a master piece from director Devi Prasad. This is realistic movie. It will hold you in entire movie and will not bore you. This movie will make you emotional. This is one of the best movies of Indian cinema.

Why everyone from odisha supporting this movie and why the IMDB rating is highLet's know Some facts1 Story based on a love story but not a love story between hero and heroine , it's a love story between a doctor and his patients2 Based on a true event Boring hi hoga ? Ans is No

ajitkumarswain-94374,13 November 2022,MASTERPIECE,"Reality on the reels. Amazing in all aspects. What is more important is the originality and the authenticity in the movie. Diversity of languages, the local language of the Swabhiman Area of Odisha gives the movie an incredible touch. Dipanwit was superb..Babushan is natural as always. The movie opens up a new era in Olywood..Finally content is the king. Movie gives you a mixed sense of emotions ,drama, and reality. The movie is above all stereotypes, beyond typical laila majnu story ,movie gives you a sense of responsibility. Excellent one.....Bravos for the cast and crew members for your gift to the world of cinema.

sriramthestranger,4 December 2022,It's documentary!,"The movie is about a doctor who is hesitant to undergo rural service and finally gives in. What follows after that is a series of incidents that changes the doctor and the belief of people.This makes up for a good documentary as the narrative is predictable, and there is no serious twists and turns in the movie.The intention of the makers to create awareness is well appreciated, but it could be better had it been told in an engaging way. There are couple of laugh moments and a good song. The VFX is tacky and camera movement is visible at many places.Good movie purely because of it awareness motive. But not worthy to watch!!

rakeshkumarsamaja,15 November 2022,Real life journey of a doctor against blind belief,I am happy that odia cinema has focused in remote area of this state. That to a true story. Beautifully narrated and presented as the best way possible. Mostly local artist were played the role with the original village plot. A film to be lived and enjoyed. The best Odia film till date. Local artistes were given the opportunity for a real audience experience. I never thought that odia film will come with some thing like this stupendous story. This film is not less than Kantara. I pledge my odia movie lovers plz go and watch this movie and feel proud of odia cinema. It should be dubbed in other languages too for a pan India audiance.,10/10,Daman
amitkray,12 November 2022,Mind Blowing Movie after a long gap,"Odia industry has immense pool of talent but they never had a good script writer. Yes some old films are there which are above par like some films of Prasant nanda, Bijay mohanty, Uttam Mohanty, Sriram Panda, Aparajita, Mahasweta ray etc. But recently films can be seldom watched, as they didnt have any unique content. Either copied from some south movies or same old family story. This film is what will make other Odia writer Directors to think that copying is not the Answer but unique content with proper presentation is the only way you can succeed in this industry.This is not a film but a true story of a doctor who even risked his life to cure villagers of several deseases, like malaria, typhoid etc for which villagers used to follow a charlatan. This is a film on how he will cure them not only from the desease but from blind faith.

thepsambit,13 November 2022,An absolute Masterpiece.,"The film is set in 2015. Siddharth, a young doctor who completed his MBBS from Bhubaneswar and has been posted to Janbai PHC, a cut-off tribal area in the Malkangiri district of Odisha.As per the guidelines of Government of Odisha, medical students studying in Government sponsored medical courses have to serve in tribal or rural areas of Odisha for 5 years otherwise they have to pay 5 crore bond price. So, Siddharth has to go there without his wishes. Janbai PHC having 151 villages under it and infamous for Naxals dominance with no basic facilities. It's his journey who fights against all odds to help and make people aware of healthcare facilities.DAMaN is One of the best movies I've ever watched. Such amazing content and a great direction. I request everyone to watch this movie once.

drgapu,11 November 2022,Such a masterpiece in Ollywood,"There are lots movies are being made in Odia Film Industry (Ollywood) every year and after OTT, some old movies are releasing on TV and OTT platforms. DAMaN, a movie based on a real-life struggle and dedication for service of a doctor played by Babushan Mohanty is an epic movie. Due to lots of circumstances, the release date of this movie was extended many time and finally released during Karika Purnima. After 15 years, I went to the theaters to watch this one and I'm lacking words to describe the experience for this one. Babushan Mohanty is the finest actors we have in Ollywood and he is the one who is suitable for this role. Dipanwit had also did a fabulous job for this character. I wish more and more movies should come like this from Ollywood.

contactchandansourav,9 November 2022,Excellent,"Must watch . Go for it. Different story. Real life story about Malkangiri in a cut off area from the main land in Odisha state of India . It's about a doctor struggle in a remote area and how he is struggling for basic infrastructure. He also tries to give up at the beginning but seeing the actual conditions of the people out there he is forced to stay back to work for them. To improve the lifestyle and hygiene of the society. It's about eridication of the maleria from the society. By involvement of all government mechanisms. It's a wonderful presentation of the situation. Go for it and watch it. Cheers.

dhalkalandi,8 November 2022,Odia movie is our Pride,"Basically Odia Movies are copied, poor stories, poor star cast and no original story..But But this odia movie Daman come to an exceptional and true story line with beautiful screen play and acting..Now I can proudly say Odia movie has a future and if director producer go through storyline like this our odia movie will do well ...I request everyone plz come and watch this odia movie.It's being four years I didn't watch a single odia movie..I personally felt Odia movie means it definitely copied from somewhere basically from South movies .Like South movies we have no budget to show like them and our star cast fail to deliver dialogue like them..so so odia audience have no interest to watch odia movie..
But this odia film Daman is a true story based on a young doctor who posted in Malkangiri and saved the people of nearly 151 villages from Malaria..

pratyushkumarhati,9 November 2022,Masterpiece. A big clap for DAMaNüëè,"Those who are says odia movie industry is now in worst condition, then once you go & watch DAMaN in ur nearby theater. From the beginning many people said that this is also a normal movie which will be remake again but after release everyone realize that the life story & struggle in Malkangiri of Dr. Omkar Hotta(In movie-Dr. Siddharth Mohanty). First time a odia movie after many years contains 95% occupancy in single screen & 70-80% occupancy in multiplex. Heads-up to all technicians, director, producer, supporting actor & specially Babushan U are amazing. Thank you for ur dedication. Please all people once you go & watch DAMaN & don't worry the whole movie screening with English Subtitles.

Respect to Babushan Mohanty. And the songs are really heart touching DaMaN nailed it. Each and every one actings are good specially the village people and Rabindra Muduli character is very genuine. Babushan as Dr. Sidharth Mohanty character is so genuine. Thanks to all the creators of DAMaN to give us a beautiful and wonderful present. Must recommend to watch this. Hopefully you loved it.

Kudos to Devi Prasad Lenka & Vishal Mourya for giving this extraordinary movie to us. This movie is a tight slap to the cuttack based so called Ollywood film makers. They should retire & give works to these kind of new. Creative filmmakers . The duos Mumbai movie making skills clearly visible on the screen.

luckyfromphone,10 November 2022,"Bhai, koso film te..","One can definitely say there are so many films about doctors, that it's hard to keep count. But, if you're in that profession - or, perhaps, a med student - this's probably one specific film about emotion n hard work done by a doctor that you can excitedly say is one of your all-time favorites. Not because it's necessarily based on anything real - though many films based on true stories - but because there's something in the film that rings true to your understanding of the job. Something you associate with the field.I found people in theater; our generation, who stopped watching an Odia movie in the fullness of time end up watching ""Daman"" would never regret. Else praising the hell out of themselves.

amarspreadlove,7 November 2022,DaMan shines through its alluring cinematography..,"Recently realised Odia drama ""DAMAN"" has put some light in the dark, indigent movie culture of Odisha. Though it has its faults, it manages to convince us through its smooth storytelling.The movie starts with a folky satirical melody nicely executed by the scenic beauty of Malkanagiri (Southern Odisha). And the movie goes well and is engaging till its interval, but after that, the direction got a bit rigid, and it feels like the director somehow wants to finish the film. The buildup in the first half doesn't compile in the second half.In terms of acting, Dipanwit has done a wonderful job, and Babusan's work is also praiseworthy, but sometimes Babusan's delivery goes superficial.Music- 7/10

Kritikalodia,9 December 2022,Half a film with a Swadesh hangover,"Yet another film about a privileged saviour of the masses which by itself makes one cringe. The film has decent camera, sound, edit, etc. But lacks originality in its presentation. The film suffers majorly from a 'Swadesh' hangover as well. But the main lacuna of the film is the improper representation of indigenous people. Moreover half way through the film it turns out to be borderline propaganda. The film tells you its a true story but paints everything in broad strokes, but more than the generalisations the film is guilty of erasure, i.e. Erasure of the truth that it wants you to believe. At one point in the film there is a full screen powerpoint presentation blurring the lines between cinema and state sponsored propaganda. The film does promise objectivity at the start, but quickly abandons it and the language of NGOs takes over. Babusan's acting is alright but one wishes a better actor with a wider range was cast. Dipanwit's is a decent performance but also a borderline caricature of regional accents and dialects. The funniest scene was to see a so called Maoist leader decked with ornaments and jewellery almost like the outlandish villains of 80s Bollywood. The film is gaining popularity because of its tragic-comedy sort of treatment although it leans more heavily on comedy and occasional sermonising by the protagonist. The film actually has nothing to offer after the first half itself. All three acts of the story are finished by the first half. The second half, as pointed out earlier, is just glorification of the Govt and the protagonist. The film's title 'Daman' means 'oppression' and is usually used to describe repression of the poor by the the powerful. Strangely in this film there is a song urging people to unite and do 'Daman' because its meant to be an abbreviation of a Govt programme for the eradication of malaria, and without this context it seems a like a war cry for more oppression of people!",1/10,Daman

savvysanket,12 November 2022,#Awestruck#,"Watched an odia movie after a gap of 14 years and found this really raw, original, masterpiece.Story, screenplay, dialogue and music lyrics were the best part of this movie. This movie should be watched atleast twice by all and word of mouth is a must. If there are good things then, there should be some improvements as well. The last 15 minutes where, a big officials from ICMS comes for a review could be more original because acting seemed to be very ordinary. An original story, performance of actors and raw background score from a very small state is something to salute. It is a masterpiece on an overall basis and must watch for all indians. #originality#uniqstory#

drgyana,14 November 2022,Best movie of 2022 deserves a national award for sure,"No heroism no mindboggling entry of lead like southindian movies..just pure raw story and emotions. Never you will see any villagers acting so natural. The raw cinematography of the place says the beauty of the place yet describes the difficulty faced by the tribal people which constutes about 50 to 60 percent of the district. How the program was created to eradicate a deadly disease abd the sacrifices of various people involved in this mission will take your breath away. The movie will restore faith in humanity and doctors and when this world is full of negativity this cute yet poweful movie will instill inspiration and poativity in you . It will motivate you to do good in life.. the acting of lead character is so natural , you cant tell he is an actor or doctor in real life. Hats off to pull a beautiful film from the oriya industry..

pranabanandanayak-84484,14 November 2022,The Renaissance !,"The 'DAMaN' can also be interpreted as ""The Man"". An inspirational journey of a Doctor who had determined to fight against the lethal Malaria in the remote area of Odisha. The obstacles he had faced and the way he overshadowed it. In short This is the Renaissance in Odia industry.Truly appreciable project budgets around 90-95 lakhs. This demonstrates the ground reality of a unreached rural Odisha. Undoubtedly the acting is very Raw and natural. We can find some rural culture along with superstitions practiced in the locality.A viral work like this "" Kantara"". From this Odia Renaissance Begins. Have a watch. This is out of Box.

tapassahoo-47142,14 November 2022,Thanks for Daman real movie,"To be Frank for every Odia movie lover, a good odia movie was just a gone day reality. I truly never thought in this life I will get an opportunity to say to the world that ""Look, this is our Odia movie."" Fortunately, Daman has demolished all my delusions.The story, the direction, the screenplay, the dialogues are just perfect. However, the music of Gourav Anand impressed the most. Dhemsa, Nichhatia Mana, Ekela Chale, Daman, all four songs are the four rays of hope for the world of Odia music. They will be in every odia soothing playlist sooner or later.Babushan is playing the lead role perfectly. No one else could be imagined in the role of Doctor Siddharth Mahanty. However, it is deepanwit who has really showcased what a able actor can add to the script. He has truly kept the audience hooked till the end. Not just these two, the truth is, all the actors, in big and small role, have performed wonderfully.Odia Cinema in the recent years have been facing heavy criticism due to lack of originality. To all those critics, it's my humble request to show some love and support now. This movie truly deserve your blessings.",10/10,Daman
rajendrasmile-22099,14 November 2022,Bhai kya movie deeko jarur!,"Epic with Masterpiece
Seriously it's been a long time since any Odia film put out the strength of the actual film. DAMaN showing the artificial picture to grab the audience to the theatre. Every minute of the scenes has a gratitude-level performance. The cinematography, Content, Location along with screenplay deserve a lot of applause. For the first time in the theatre of Odisha, the Audience stand and cheers in the climax scene. It is coming with emotional attachment, Love, care, and an understanding the naturalism. DAMaN is originally a biography movie about a doctor who appears to be a lot of problems when a cut-off area people are not able to get a basic level of treatment. Go watch and feel the theme of DAMaN.....

mishrarubin,25 December 2022,"Not a movie, but a treatise on life, struggle, perseverance and success","Daman is an experience; not just a movie. It's a reminder to all privileged Indians, that 30% of our countrymen, the tribals still live in conditions that our human brains cannot comprehend. These people live without electricity, without connectivity, without access to healthcare even in the age of Digital India / smart cities. Despite Hardships, way to effect change is individual determination, intent and above all, ability to coordinate/motivate people on ground to achieve the cause. The film should be mandated in every schools and colleges. Every scene gives goosebumps. Never seen before movie in India.

hariownworld,15 November 2022,Best Oriya movie of the decade,Like father like son. A genuine actor. A realstic story. An inspirational movie. TRUE U+ movie for generations of people.Babusan lived the story.Should be dubbed in Hindi so that actress like Prakruti Mishra and Ekta Kapoor can understand the story and make these kind of movies instead focusing on feminism.Lots of love and warmth for all the actors involved in this movie.For sure this movie will be considered for national award.I would like to see these kind of movies across all states at least twice a year and people will definitely encourage if the story is rich.Hope other actor and producer will follow this suite.,10/10,Daman
mailjagpanda,28 November 2022,Milestone of a new beginning,"Story is very engaging. Some time you know what is going to be happen but the story telling you keep you focused. Scenic beauty is just awesome, the camera is operated perfectly to capture the beautiful Odisha.Babusan always a good actor and singer, I am happy that he has came back with a strong presence in heart of the audience.Dipanwit Dasmohapatra just act a fuel for the story. His action is just outstanding. You will feel the pain of helpless ness of the character and joy of achieving the things through his acting.I really loved watching the film and will love to see more like this coming.

deepakete,19 November 2022,A must watch movie,"The last Odiya movie I saw was ""I love you"" which more than a decade old. After reading the reviews and words of mouth, I decided to watch the movie and believe me it was a wise decision. A very nice movie with excellent content and worthy of spending time and money for it. Few things could have been better but I will ignore that because I am seeing such a movie after a very long time and I was not expecting such movie from our current industry where copy paste and same love story movies are being made. I personally feel, this movie will help our movie industry to establish the fame. Odia industry should encourage making more and more such movies. Kudos to the Daman team ...

The director and the producer have done a fantastic job with each and every part of the film. The story of the medical facilities in rural India, including how the reality compares to the government's policies and schemes, which are consistently ignored. Well-handled discussion of a subject that is rarely brought up in real life.The cinematography, the direction, and the song are all of equal quality.It is very mind blowing to see the grandeur of the jungles of Malkanigiri and Koraput, as well as the culture of the Adivasi people.

mpmohanta,27 November 2022,"Good Story, Nice Cinematography, Nice Songs, Real Story but unreal portryal","Everyone praising this movie. So after long saw a movie in Cinema Hall. This is a good movie, storyline is something unique and inspired from real life success story of a doctor. Cinematography is verygood, Babushan has himself sung the beautiful songs in the picturescque Malkangiri. But it could have been better. The story of the reallife hero Dr Omkar Hota is very different. The Hero Sidharth Mohanty seemed very haughty, reluctant and unrealistic. Dr Omkar Hota won the hearts of Tribal people by his sheer dedication, hardwork, selfless service with unimaginable tenacity, courage, patience and persistance. But Dr Sidharth seemed to use force and fear as motivating factors, which could not have worked in real. Dr Omkar Hota went to Chitrakonda by his own choice, as he has described in his many interviews ( You can find tem in Yutube). But hero in this movie went there reluctantly. The story writer has taken Dr Omkar's story very superficially and the director has failed in picturising his character. I could percieve Dr Omkar (from his interviwes ) a man of extraordinary convictions, determination, will power, superbly intelligent, calm and down to earth person. But Dr Sidharth was haughty, unrespectful (to the tribal people), immature, superficial, moody, unstable and arrogant. It could have been a betterwatch if the real Dr Omkar Hota could have been shown in the movie.",5/10,Daman

Good news for non odia flim lover this film will be released in Hindi dubbed.damam movie's main lead character Babusan, great actor in this film Babusan acting was phenomenal, moral of story is never quite of any field still you get achievements. Don't believe superstition, black magic . Believe in ur strength keep hardworking to get success. One more thing said in this film was fear which has in our mind . Before going to work you get nervous because of fear. Try to extract your fear in ur mind. You will definitely win in every field.

bibhutimohapatra,17 November 2022,Daman review,"This is the best movie in odia I have ever seen.Acting is so natural and actors are so keen in their acting, and they choose the location (i.e Koraput) where the incidence happened to make the movie more realistic as well as attractive. I have seen it twice and now I am waiting for its Hindi version, not only i but also my friend who are in karanataka are also excited to see the movie inthe theatre, by the movie we came to know that a doctor from odisha posted in a remote area could be able to change the superstition of the people by his selfless and dedicated work and eradicated malaria around 151 villages in Koraput area.

Sad part is it is relesed in few theaters. A must watch movie should be relesed in more areas not just with just a one show..Since long I have not seen any odia movie with such an impactful presentation of our state. It will take time to come out of it's impact ...A must watch ,amazingly scripted & well narrated with tribal setting to convey social message. Acting by every cast is simply wonderful. 1st half is too good , it really keeps you gripped onto your seat..really feeling very proud after watching this one..its time to support our own movie so please come forward Kudos to the team for coming up with such a top notch content.

sandipsahoonitr,19 November 2022,Absolute watershed moment in Ollywood with a Brilliantly done movie,"Babushaan and Debi has really upped the ante for all movies to come after this. Solid acting, great cinematography with humorous takes in a region which has never been truly represented in Odia cinema. This is one Odia movie which deserves to be dubbed in Hindi and taken to a national audience. Kudos to the team!Siddhartha Mohanty is a doctor who serves in Malkangiri district of Southern Odisha. He however hails from Bhubaneswar - long term economic disparities between coastal and hinterlands goes back centuries in Odisha. Under servicing of public services in the hinterlands has been two pronged- negligence by Bhubaneswar and its largely Savarna denizens and old, animist adivasi traditions. Without addressing the historical disparities, the movie still does a brilliant job of showing the story of a hardworking doctor (Omkar Hota in real life) who brings real change to the thinking of the adivasis he serves!

bandanlinu,7 December 2022,Great movie,"This movie tells us about the real social problems that are commonly faced in Maoists adivasi area of Odisha. The lead actor ""BABUSHAN MOHANTY"" 's acting is extraordinary. The director also gave importance to small small things and the way director directed the movie is fabulous. Being a odia I can surely say that this is the best ever odia movie made in the history of odia cinema. This story is also based on true events and this movie will also inspire the forthcoming young generation .It feels good to see regional movies are performing better than bollywood movie in these recent years.so bollywood should learn from these.

m-ramanan,3 June 2022,Kamal version of Kaithi...Highly recommended,"RATED 10/10
Language: Tamil
Media Partner: Hotstar
Source: NIL
RECOMMENDEDKamal's most action packed film delivered without any lag from beginning to end. Even though we have bunch of stars in the cast, Vikram shines out everyone, at the same time everyone's space is kept well...
Movie has lot of Easter eggs from the beginning to end. Lot of reference to Lokesh and Kamal movie references.The movie is surprise sequel to ""kaithi"".Lokesh compromised little bit in master, here its full and full Lokesh show with mass moments. First half Kamal is there in very few scenes only, but shown as much as possible shades of him. The first half belongs to Fahad and VS. The interval block with Vikram BGM ending is ultimate. The first half is kind of perfect version of ""valimai"".Second half is filed with action sequences. The Milk fight scene and climax Kaithi fights are top notch. Movie has more gore and violent graphics...Lokesh handled the second half brilliantly and balanced with all cast perfectly. Very big Kudos to Lokesh... Climax Surya's cameo and Other surprises are claps worthy....
Must watch for everyone and Repeat watch for Kamal/movie fans.Getting ready for the next show.",10/10,Vikram
personalacc-87247,3 June 2022,A 100% LOKESH MOVIE!,"This film will not disappoint you. What a comeback from Kamal.It's a sequel from 2019 Kaithi, every character was detailed properly.It's definitely not like Master! It's a Marana Lokesh padam.Vera level work by ANIRUDH!Family audience should realise this is the new commercial entertainer.The type of emotional mass masala movies should be dead! It's 2022 not 2005!Overall: a treat for cinema fans! 9/10This is the pride of Tamil cinema after multiple failures by big actors! (Not gonna mention who)",9/10,Vikram
nidhunmoviebuff,3 June 2022,A fanboy film that celebrates Kamal Hassan to the fullest extent!,"The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kamal Hassan starrer ""Vikram"" has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with ""Maanagaram (2017)"", ""Kaithi (2019)"" and ""Master (2021)"", all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.3-time National Award winner for Best Actor Kamal Hassan stars as a grieving father heartbroken at the loss of his son, who was a policeman investigating the burgeoning drug mafia in Chennai and who had, before his mysterious murder, uncovered a staggering cache of illegal drugs the syndicate safeguarded . Enter Fahadh Faasil, a black ops specialist charged with unraveling the mystery around the carnage unleashed by the cartel as a result. Vijay Sethupathi stars as the head honcho of the vicious and vengeful mafia operation and is first shown to the audience in one of the most intricately weaved, deliciously bonkers intro sequences for an antagonist in recent memory.It is testament to Lokesh Kanagaraj's directorial genius that he manages to give his three lead actors enough room to develop their characters and build a connect with the viewers. If it is Sethupathi's quirky eccentricities that catch the eye, Fahadh's intensity weaves a subplot of its own while Kamal excels in the emotional sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj had told us to rewatch his classic ""Kaithi (2019)"" before we went to theaters to watch ""Vikram"" and with good reason, with the two movies being intricately connected and seemingly leading up to an extensive LKU-A mouth-watering Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe! A fantastic cameo from superstar Suriya is the cherry on the cake, with the actor looking the most stylish and massy he has in years!The director's penchant for crime thrillers, retro music and biryani continues to hold good for ""Vikram"" with Anirudh Ravichander's music rendering a soaring sheen to the narrative being built. The callbacks and references to old Kamal classics blend smoothly with the storytelling and are never jarring or contrived. The actor's phenomenal voice modulation and expressive eyes elevate even simple sequences to another level, especially his interactions with his toddler grandson.Master stunt choreographer duo Anbariv continue the same rich vein of form they displayed in the KGF franchise, but this time sacrificing the larger canvas for more close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat in tight spaces. Girish Gangadharan's cinematographer is other-worldly as usual, soaking up the bone-crunching action in all its glory. Editor Philomin Raj also deserves praise for ensuring that a movie with a seemingly daunting 3 hour run-time is never boring at any stretch.While you might see many of the plot's twists coming, the visual grammar, treatment and picturization takes your breath away, nevertheless. ""Vikram"" is yet another endeavor from a superstar fanboy that pays rich dividends, along the lines of Prithviraj's Mohanlal tribute ""Lucifer (2019)"", Karthik Subbaraj's Rajnikanth-starrer ""Pettah (2019)"" as well as Amal Neerad's ode to Mammootty, ""Bheeshma Parvam (2022)"". Highly recommended! Long live the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe!",9/10,Vikram
thujan,3 June 2022,Kamal is back! Time to show how's it done.,"Very engaging screenplay and overall great performances by all stars. A lot of fan moments to enjoy. Looking forward to future installments of the Vikram series. Congratulations to Lokesh and team.

msunando,4 June 2022,"Once upon a time, there lived a ghost!","Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146 minutes of running timeThe film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them. This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business. Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission to rid the nation of the drug menace.Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.",9/10,Vikram

IPyaarCinema,24 July 2022,Stylish Entertainer,"Lokesh Kanagaraj's idea to make an universe out of his films expands with Vikram. The movie begins where Kaithi ends. Two containers full of costly drugs go missing. The local Pablo Escobar, Santhanam (Vijay) is hell bent on finding it. Amid this is a group of masked killers killing people who have something in common. The police hire a shadow gang to find them out and the drama unfolds.There is style, unimaginable action sequences, Thrill , suspense and all of this performed by some of the most talented actors Indian houses right now. Fafa gets to play the most interesting part as he transforms with the movie. There is a journey to his submission to the lawless justice and when you have an actor of Faasil's calibre it only becomes hauntingly beautiful. Kamal Haasan makes a comeback after a long time and he is superb in his action avatar.

maulin5,4 June 2022,Good movie with Great Performances,"Vikram is one of the most interesting and anticipating movie for everyone because of the massive star cast. After Pushpa, RRR and KGF Chapter 2, Vikram is released to roar. The film is a complete commercial paisa wasool movie.First half of the movie is fantastic. Fahadh Faasil is the best young actor in today's time according to me. He has done a superb job. Vijay Setupathy is a gem of an actor. I loved his entry scene here. No other actor can pull up this entry scene as he has done it. Other star cast is also very much suitable and provide a good support. First half belongs to FaFa and Vijay.While, the second half is a treat for Kamal Haasan fans. Ulaga Nayagan- Kamal Haasan is extremely good in the post interval portion. You will be surprised to see him firing constantly from the giant machine gun. That scene is on another level.Though, one may find first half awesome and second half a bit stretched. I found that there are some surprises in the later half, but there are a few blunders too. But just a few. Like I didn't get the scene of child re-breathing.Special mention to the actress who played the role of a maid. She is superb.Lokesh's direction is improving gradually. This film will be considered his finest directorial product. He has done a fine job, without getting caught by the idea of too much slow-motion, which many people hate including me, and which were too much in KGF. Though, this film is different from RRR and KGF, it can be compared with Pushpa. As part 2 is coming here too. People are going to love Surya as the bad guy in part two. Just a glimpse of him in the end was terrific.Anirudhha has done his job superbly once again. The title theme music is on my mind while I'm writing this. Extraordinary music with a catchy tune is what Anirudhha offers to you!On the whole, a must watch movie in theaters. This is how a good commercial south indian movie looks like. A good movie with stellar performances.",9/10,Vikram
arungeorge13,12 June 2022,Can't wait to see what Lokesh does with the universe he's built! [+82%],"The greatest challenge for Lokesh Kanagaraj, as a filmmaker, wasn't just to offer several hoot-worthy moments for fans of Kamal Hassan, but to come up with a first-of-its-kind pure action film featuring a trio of actors who are known for their spectacular performances. His packaging totally delivers, with a fantastic outing for all the guys involved. Plotwise speaking, Vikram is basically The Batman set in Chennai. A serial killer is on the loose, and a special ops team is tasked with finding the culprit. While that's just one way of putting it across, Vikram is a lot beyond that. It's also about a father avenging his son's death, and a massive drug bust; it's also about gangsters, special agents, and rogue cops - Lokesh's universe-building skills are excellent!I'm SO GLAD Lokesh chose these actors to play their respective roles. Vijay Sethupathi's antagonist act is even more menacing than the one in Master, and when he's high, he's next-level. Fahadh Faasil essentially holds the proceedings together in the first half, in a solid feat that keeps getting better. As for Hassan, this is a film where the director just lets him run amok, going absolutely wild in the set-pieces. Speaking of the set-pieces (choreographed by Anbariv), these are some of the most well-crafted and staged works you'll see in an Indian film in a good while. DOP Girish Gangadharan captures all the pyro-filled beauty of the action, while also using close-ups to pick up the subtler expressions of the dashing trio.And there is no Vikram without Anirudh Ravichander, whose remarkable music and background score elevate the film to greater heights. The riff-filled theme music is one that'll stay on my playlist for a pretty long time. The editing by Philomin Raj ensures a certain pace to the film's events, even when it shows signs of slowing down. Suriya's late entry sparks even more delight when he's playing a full-blown baddie, with chances of him squaring off against Dilli (from Kaithi) all the more possible now. Yes, (re)watch Kaithi before seeing Vikram for an enhanced universe-building experience.",8/10,Vikram
drkshitij-24847,9 June 2022,Overdose of Style with Scarcity of Meaning and Substance,"Lokesh is one of my favorite director and my favorite film of him is Master, it was Awesome combination of storytelling, emotions and Fan service of Vijay.Here, I guess Lokesh was trying to live his childhood dream and encorporated everything he loves in a single movie and tried to make it the greatest movie of all time but he only succeeded partially. As a Refrence I would like to say 'he was trying to make a Guy Ritchie film with a SS Rajamouli film with a Michael Bay film with with a Quentin Tarantino film' all four in one along with full tribute and Fan service to kamal hasan & full utilisation of Fahadh Faasil. In the process he went into overkill mode & as a result the film visually looks Awesome with some great mass moments but that's about it, you take nothing home with you. You don't care about the story or the characters much, you just wait for the next mass moment and action scene. Also in trying to tick so many boxes he wasted awesome Vijay Sethupathi ,who was phenomenal in Master but he had nothing much to do in this film, he was just a generic villian whose only role was to growl looking at the camera.Now I am going to talk a bit about SPOILERS for those who have seen the movie, and for those who haven'tSPOILER ALERTEveryone's Excited about Surya's cameo, his character was build up like he was the boss of all bosses; but I didn't feel one bit intimidated or intrigued by his presence.Instead of the star presence and the gravity that he has there was nothing new or exciting about his character, he was shouting, trying to be menacing and unpredictable but his role just went flat for me. It didn't kept me hooked or Excited on how he would produce a great challenge and antagonist to Kamal Hasan's character in the next part, it just looked like Surya was trying to play a drug addict mob boss villian.All in all it's a decent watch for Kamal Hasan, Fahadh Faasil some action sequences and mass moments but nothing more than that.",6/10,Vikram

cs_rahul_kumar,8 July 2022,VIKRAM is a Treat to Watch with Spectacular Performances from All The Actors !!!,"Filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj uses the talent of actors Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and Kamal Haasan brilliantly in his latest venture Vikram.Vikram is a befitting comeback of Kamal Haasan to satiate his fans' 4-year-long hunger to see him on the big screen. The title Vikram is borrowed from the actor's own film which released in 1986. However, the story is set in director Lokesh Kanagaraj's cinematic universe wherein he has interlinked characters from his previous directorial Kaithi and the old Vikram. The music of the film is composed by Anirudh Ravichander and the dialogues are written by Rathna Kumar along with the director.Lokesh Kanagaraj has loaded Vikram with a battalion of characters but he has ensured that all of them have their due scope to perform, even though some might have lesser screen time including 'Ulaga Naayagan'.This simply shows his prowess as a writer who values his story over simply paying the fanboy tributes to his guru Kamal Haasan for the sake of it. But that doesn't mean there is a dearth of mass moments for his favorite star. Every time Kamal makes his entry, the background music with Anirudh's voice - 'Once upon a time, there lived a ghost' - feels electrifying, quite literally.Vikram truly comes alive post the adrenaline-filled interval scene. Action is Lokesh's forte and the second-half has impressive stunts (stunt directors are Anbariv masters) and a superior camera work by Girish Gangadharan.Watching Kamal Haasan, who is apparently 67 years old but certainly doesn't look that way on screen in this all new action avatar takes one back in time to the early days of the actor's career - younger and dapper.The film is in a way an ode to the veteran actor with umpteen number of references from his older films like Kuruthipunal, Panchatanthiram, and Nayakan. Dark humour to detailing, all departments of Vikram have worked in unison to render a massive salute to the exemplary filmography of the legendary Kamal Haasan.On the other hand, Vijay Sethupathi is remarkable as Santhanam especially in his whistle worthy and quirky introduction scene. Though it was refreshing to see him try out something new shedding off his usual Sethupathi-ness, his tight-lipped dialogue delivery instead of coming across as an interesting characterization was only a major distraction.However, Fahadh Faasil steals the show with an all round performance exhibiting passion, love and revenge at perfect levels.Kamal Haasan is, as has been emphasized already, fabulous. Vijay Sethupathi fleshes out an edgy criminal whose frazzled heart and addled mind push him in startling directions. Fahadh Faasil sails through his role with such aplomb that one can never have enough of him. How tantalizing is the prospect that the consummate show-stealer will be back to reprise the role - repeatedly hopefully - as the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe expands and moves into the future!",10/10,Vikram

OnjiMooteDaMarle,9 July 2022,"When the actor becomes bigger than the story, the story loses it's life","Apart from a brilliant Sethupathi & an above average Fahadh, there is nothing in this film that makes it worth spending nearly 3 hours let alone any money. There is drugs & gangsters with politicians. Then there is a suspense that is so diluted that you know it from the very beginning what it is because of the casting. When the actor become bigger than the story, the story loses it's value, shine & life. The director tried to make it a show with unnecessary style but it is played so many times in films. The story is bland and has nothing new to offer not even any moments to remember. The VFX is below par even for a Tamil film. The music & the lyrics are worse than the screenplay. The teaser that was shown of the film was a show. Nothing in the film resonated with the teaser. The teaser was excellent with Kamal getting ready to feed a lot of big shots probably gangsters at the same time gets ready with guns and ammunitions. So the teaser was a fluke.Why does Kamal Hassan's face look so much filled with VFX or make up? It looked bad in the trailer itself. Make him look his real self! I am in awe of Vijay Sethupathi's expressions. His first I watched was Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom. While actors go for 6 pack and body transformations to show off themselves (and not their acting skills) Sethupathi's physique has never come in between his class acting. Sethu should stop taking such films. He's already done Vikram Vedha & Master with similar roles. Fahad is a brilliant actor as well but he is so good in dramas more than such action films especially Malayalam dramas.Aniruddh's music has always been more of a copy of what has been already heard be it using Ilayaraja's old music for his 'famous' Why this kolaveri d or be it here the lullaby that has so much resemblance to the opening credit song from Nayakan - Thenpandi Cheemayile. The music is a huge dud. I hate the way films say 'an aniruddh musical'. That's what you say about Ilayaraja or A. R. Rahman. This boy hasn't come out with any music that has transcended boundaries and with the kind of music he produces, I doubt he ever will.If they are going for a sequel, hope they write better. Finally Welcome Suriya!",1/10,Vikram

Brilliant performance from Kamal sir and it's the best comeback. All the performances from the rest of the crew is great to watch.The soundtrack from Anirudh sir is stunning and makes it completely engaging. Surya sir role atlast is magical and completely unexpected and brilliantly shot. This film has few references to Kaithi film, hence learning some main characters in Kaithi will help you in understanding some scenes better in this film.

BradCharles1,8 June 2022,"If you're looking for a crass, story-lite, overhyped movie, this is for you","I'll admit it- i loved the original Vikram movie (1986) which was a spy thriller and ahead of its time in Indian cinema. Not surprisingly, I had similar expectations for this movie as I walked in.Lo and behold, I was hit with a badly done knockoff copy of reservoir dogs/pulp fiction/KGF coupled with crass dialogues, cuss words and poor character development (apart from Kamal's character). This turned out to be a typical mass masala movie involving gangsters, corrupt police officials whom the hero literally mows down using a WW-I era machine gun. I wish I could get back those 3 hours of my life, my money and my dead brain cells.Needless to say, this is going to be my last kamal movie. If you're a die-hard kamal fan who doesn't care about others think and wants to kill some time watching this in a theater, go for it.",1/10,Vikram

MehdiRizvi-7867,13 June 2022,Beast And Thriller Movie,"##First day, First show in Fun Mall.There comes several Pan-Indian movies in 2022- Kgf 2, RRR, etc. But, this movie is something special. After KGF: Chapter 2, it was Vikram, which I loved a lot. Be it the cast performance, cinematography, editing and direction, everything was picture-perfect and top-notchüëçüèªüëèüèªüëåüèΩüëåüèΩThere were lots and lots of Wowww moments in the film. In the first half, Actor Fahadh Fasil sir completely steals the show through his macho body and eyes. Vijay Sethupathi too steals the show as menacing villain. He made me to hate his character. Such a splendid performance.Second Half- Completely belongs to our Aandavar! None other than our great Kamal Hassan ayya. Our Ulaga Nayakan sir! Lots of goosebumps and firy momentsüî•üî•üî•The song Naayakan meendum varaan was really a worth. It's a mass comeback of our great Ulaganayakan. Pathala Pathala gave me vibes.The way Lokesh sir links the scenes with Kaithi was massy and superb. Supporting actors- Narain sir, Arjun Das sir, Harish Uthaman sir and the rest had limited screen to share. However, they left an impact through their intensity. I felt there is some connection between Kaithi and this film. Let's wait and watch. In the end, Suriya sir's cameo appearence is another big highlight. Everyone must watch his scene.So, coming to the direction, I loved Lokesh sir's way of linking the plot. After Kaithi, this was the film, I loved the most along with his Master and Maanagaram. Lots of twists and turns are there in the film.Music and BGM by Anirudh Anna was awesomeüëåüèΩüëèüèªAnd coming to the stunt sequences by Anbariv Anna. They have given lots of soul and efforts to this film. Especially the gun scene in the climax. It was more goosebumps than KGF: Chapter 2, where the same was shot. Enna, anga Periyappa! Inga namma Vikram sir! Avlo thaan. But, marana mass scene. The film have inspired me to work on different stories in the storymirror alongside KGF: 2 and Tenet.My rating: 5/5üëåüèΩüí•Worth a watch nanbargale. As I said, ""Sirapaana tharamaana sambavam irukku."" Kollywood would go to the Pan-India level with the help of our Ulaga Nayakan ayya and this is an inspiration for me as an aspiring and upcoming film director of Kollywood. If KGF: Chapter 2 inspired me to work on gangster genres and create a similar universe of those, Vikram is in top-notch. It had inspired me to think to next level of developing and thinking spy stories. A new path for innovative screenplays. Thank you Lokesh sir! Thank you so much for giving us a memorable film. Keep making films like this!üòòüí•üí•",10/10,Vikram
saru2020,26 June 2022,India's(tamil cinema's) first ever spin-off movie,"This is probably the first-ever spin-off kinda film that too with so many top actors playing in it and luckily it has also worked very well.The plot isn't so intriguing but the screenplay and twists & turns of so many characters all over the film are something that has worked really well, especially the Agent Tina character came as a huge surprise and the linkage of Kaithi as the film happening in the same timeline is something that keeps us hooked and finally the Surya character although being so shuttle, it gives a very good lead for the sequel.Another spin-off like this could be the journey of the Rayappan character from Bigil, this probably might take Vijay's status to some other level but only time will tell if it'd happen at all.Irumugan/Lucy kinda drug sequences with Vijay Sethupathi aren't so attractive to have in the film unless they got portrayed by him so differently starting from the introduction of auto balti action sequence.And most importantly, the possibility of having so many spin-offs with marvels like Loki-universe(LCU) is something that could take this Tamil cinema to a wholly different level. This is supposedly the start of Tamil cinema's upward journey.Kamal is the only top actor who's comfortable in sharing screen space with co-actors in the industry to a greater extent which is why this film has paid him off so handsomely after a very very long time, its good to see that his ambitions would grow further in delivering a quality film that takes up the industry standards.And not to mention, the real hero of the film is Anirudh, the BGM and the soundtracks are nothing but just his best and totally exceptional ones, this is probably the rock star's best, IMAO.",10/10,Vikram
isaacsundaralingam,3 June 2022,"Loud, obnoxious and fun... At least for the most part","As much as I enjoyed this movie, I still feel like this shouldn't have been a Kamal Haasan movie.Kamal has had a string of great movies recently... With Unnaipol Oruvan; a dialogue-heavy movie where the conflict required no excessiveness, with Vishwaroopam; a movie while flawed, was ambitious enough to take Tamil cinema to a non-Tamil accustomed front, with Uttama Villain; one of Kamal Haasan's best movies to date that is one of the very few movies in this exaggerated industry to consciously portray cinema as an actual art form, with Papanasam; one of the most simplest, yet a brilliantly made thrillers, with Thoongavanam; a movie that seemed to rid itself of every cliche that plagues the Tamil cinema industry (this includes the runtime as well), and Vishwaroopam 2; well.... Vishwaroopam 2 never happened.And after 4 years, we have a new Kamal Haasan movie; which while enjoyable by Tamil cinema standards, doesn't have the ambitions and the cinematic progressiveness that Kamal movies have had. It was very well written, especially in its first half, but ultimately ends up being a Tamil action movie and I need not asterisk anything. The energy of the movie never waned and while it did seem like the writers hyped the story into a cliche third act, the movie holds up well, very well in fact, in the entertainment box.Overall, I'd rather have seen this movie with some other actor since I feel like this macho persona is best left for someone that is not Kamal Haasan... not that he's bad at it, he actually did a stellar job, but because as of right now, he's the only big name Tamil actor to push the boundaries of this cursed industry. The last thing I'd want from him is the usual Tamil archetype overpowered Super Saiyan freak that we've seen a million times.",7/10,Vikram
crazyraju,5 June 2022,Average Film with good action block and predictable Twists,"Storyline - Agent Vikram (Kamal) with his masked identity leads a masked gang, who have their own tragic story in their past because of a dreadly drug mafia. Agent Vikram fights against the drug mafia, headed by Santhanam (Vijay Sethupathi) with the help of an undercover agent Amar (Fahad Fasil) and Bejoy (Narein). How does he successfully defeat the gang of Santhanam, forms the rest of the story.Performance wise, Kamal and Fahad Fasil have done their part good. If first half of the film is dominated by Fahad Fasil, second half of the film is dominated by Kamal Hassan. Vijay Sethupathi's villain role could have been better as comparing his role in ""Master"", the villain role in this film seems to be weak.The film has surprise cameo roles connected with director's previous films. The film has got good production values but screenplay of the film is simple and many twists are quite predictable.Direction wise, the film is not as good as edge of the seat thriller ""Kaithi"" nor it is not as bad as ""Master"". The film is an average commercial flick with good action block.",5/10,Vikram
ksiraj-61833,3 June 2022,one of the best movie of 2022 deserves national awards,"In this movie we can find action emotions good background score kamal haasan played outstanding performance in this movie and vijay and fahad also played good acting i watch this movie in hindi dubbed but voice of all characters is amazing no doubt worth to watch not a single minute is wasting this movie may defeat all records because this movie bring something new that audience doesn't expect 3 actors have different stories and story and direction is absolutely nice it deserves this movie has made my day 10/10.

ujjudoc,13 August 2022,I am not joking,"What a shame to see how reviews are made or bought... Scrip writing... Impractical and bad, action sequences are such as if godly persons are acting in a drama which is action packed, these sequences are hard to believe to be real. Explanation of killing the members of the elite gang was just best joke of the movie. 8.4 imdb rating for such a movie... Really unbelievable.. I will rate it under 5.

amey_date,11 July 2022,One sided boring movie,A 65 yaar old grand pa jumping off buildings and fights with 100's of people and does stunts unrealistic stupid one sided boring movie .what's the point of keeping actors like Vijay sethupathy and fahadh fassil if you just want to show Kamal Hasan outdoing them in every step ? Looks one sided stupid movie hence the one star.So many illogical things in the movie made me give a 1 star rating .Kamal Hasan gets stabbed with a knife on his back twice and next scene still he fights with 100's of people without any blood dripping or any disability and the wound won't even be shown in the next scene what a joke !!The child is pulseless for more than 5 mins and then they do cpr and revive the child that's another loophole because anyone would be brain dead by 3 mins if you don't do cpr so many loopholes in a so called masterpiece with a 10 star rating come on don't fool others giving such high rating for a movie with so many loopholes and faults when there are better masterpiece movies you can give such high ratings .,1/10,Vikram
trybeingarun,9 July 2022,People are just plot points,"Extremely boring movie. Not an organic story. Just a bunch of plot points posing as people moving a messy plot forward.Eg. No reason for Fahaad to disclose Kamal's personal information to villains, but for the reason that the plot needs it.No need for Fahaad to destroy a certain building but for the reason that the plot needs it.No need for Kamal to be portrayed as an out and out bad guy in the first half an hour but for the reason the plot thinks it's cool
Vijay Sethupathi's character is out and out hilarious. He commands 0 respect and has no screen presence.

the protagonist in the second scene of the movie. Except for an overdose of ultra violence with deafening ammunition sounds, the movie has everything for an action film enthusiast. Primarily, all

1986), highway scene (from managram) makes it first Indian movie to have multiverse (as in Avengers).Anirudh's score makes your adrenaline gushing down the spine in ecstasy.

He is easily beating the hell out of them. Same for co-actors. 20-30 villains are firing, not even a single bullet hits the hero while all the villians are dead. Places RDX inside a gangster's lab, while gangster didn't even realised that.. Talk about realism and story plot.. Do these directors really think Indian people are this dumb. If you are used to watching decent global crime detective thrillers, even some classic national/regional ones, then avoid this movie by all possible means. Total time waste.

sunildaswaney,8 June 2022,TOTALLY ILLOGICAL MOVIE,"VIKRAM had a fairly good story but it was totally buried by mindless action and totally illogical sequences. Kamal Hassan at 67 years old was indulging in action sequences with such vigour,energy and supreme strength as if he were in his 20s-to early 40s! After receiving such heavy beatings he miraculously recovered relatively unscathed to beat the villain almost to a pulp. Although he is an outstanding actor his role in this movie did not require him to display his acting prowess,but just indulge in endless and mindless action sequences and pretending to be drunk. With the exception of Amar who was quite competent, and the maid who was brilliant in her action scenes,the acting was extremely bad with Chandan being particularly useless. All in all this was a film that was made for the masses with the tagline""LEAVE YOUR BRAINS AT HOME""

rajesh-puvvada,3 June 2022,Kamal Delivers a Killer Punch!!,"*Vikram 2*_A Review by Rajesh Puvvada_*A* Tamil movie release in Pune on a working day. One would expect empty seats and a few loyal fans. I was pleasantly surprised when many fans were patiently watching the board with words ""Cleaning in Progress"". Lower level seats got filled up, and I made sure of that, when we all stood up for the National Anthem. People were a *plenty.**N* arcotics mafia gang movies have a common theme, gory ways of killing people. Intelligent ways of escaping, and the good guys finish up winning after many bruises. My original feeling was it is yet another Narcos extension. My feeling got crushed, when the movie starts with a search. A search to demystify an undercover agent. Amar(Fahad Fazil) the good cop tries to demystify the undercover a serial killing pattern, but realises it is a much bigger and a sinister plan behind it. He realises the serial killing spree was triggered by the capture of a Raw Narcotic *bounty*.*D* etermined to demystify, he travels to a great extent and finds out the various facets of Karnan (Kamal), who is actually is a victim of the serial killing. And that way we miss Kamal most of the first half of the movie. Amar's path crosses with Sandhanam (Vijay sethupathy) a quack, meth cook and a terrible gangster. The entry of Sandhanam is not from a glittering higher end automobile, but from a normal rickety auto rickshaw. The entry was really different, bear and very intriguing. Sandhanam's trade mark teeth line and his lip position to reveal it adds to the gory face lift. Every inch of his body and the every move of his will give you a characteristic of a thug on the move to regain his *booty.**A* nriudh's score beats all normalcy. It's the score and the power of the star cast that will let you live the movie through out. Karnan is revealed like a flickering lamp, which flickers after a long interval and over time flickers faster till it glitters brightly. The goose bump moment of the movie feels real. Even in that high octane pace of the movie, the audience clapping and whistling could not be missed. Though one can easily mark the behaviour of the audience as a first day first show mania, I sensed more *novelty.**V* ersatility at its best, is what I would sum up Kamal's performance with. No matter, whom you bring in, be it Amar, Sandhanam or Rolex (Surya), Vikram makes the entire cast look like an adorable puppy. No one can ignore an adorable puppy but one has to feel the ghost through out. Keep aside the ideologies and political inclinations, as a thespian Kamal outclasses every one in the movie. A great treat from Kamal after a long hiatus. Trust me the septuagenerian can shake a leg with a lot of ease, and he can put us all in shame. No exaggeration or a sublime performance, it was *brevity.**A* uthentic screenplay and script. Lokesh Kanakaraj does in best but stitching parts from his earlier blockbusters into this one. You will see scenes from Kaidhi snuggly nestled into this movie. The first half leaves a lot of moving parts in your mind and in the second half you will see that all those parts falling in place seamlessly. Thats the beauty of closing the loop efficiently. A lot of action in the movie, but I never felt anything superfluous, I felt it was all adding up. The introduction of the first batch of the special task force was pulsating. The revealing of the lady agent was simply outstanding, look forward for it. The metaphor used to rescue the next generation was very interesting, follow the path of the kid in the movie and you will realise what I mean by it. In the end all the twists will deliver a lot of *Clarity.**R* apid action scenes packed by Lokesh, wonderful background score of Anirudh, smart use of ageing weapons, expressive eyes of Fahad Fazil, Glittering teeth of Vijay Sethupathi and relentless performance of Kamal will give you all a wholesome treat. Oops! I forgot to remind you all the age of the Ulaganayagan. He is young at *Seventy*4.5/5 for the movie. A score of an infinity for Kamal. I just got my tickets booked for a repeat viewing on Sunday, and I am sure you will do many repeats.",9/10,Vikram

gokulnaths_007,8 June 2022,Over rated,"I felt vikram like an average action film. I felt like losing continuity between the scenes. All the action were used in the second half. I felt lag in the pace. Personally i liked the vijay sethupathi's character. And his introduction scene was awesome. All the actors performance was good. But i felt some of gripping elements was missing from the movie. I should say it is a theatre experience for the sound effects and robotic camera scenes. The fight sequences were also nice.

manirsoffl,3 June 2022,A ticket to Lokesh's Universe,"There were so much of fan theories around when the trailer was released. Well thats probably it. The way he connected the this film's story with Kaithi was exceptional. By hinting to re-watch Kaithi before entering into Vikram world, there started a phenomenal hype towards the film. Now coming to the film, Kamal sir did what is needed for the film. A subtle and tremendous performance. Fahadh in the other hand a unsung lead for the film, who untie the knots to make us more interesting. Vijay Sethupthi had the lower screen space and less performance comparing to the others. The last freaking cameo of Suriya was outstanding and a brilliant move to put on us on edge. Whole audience erupted. Now coming to the flaws the story was much predictable and screenplay was slow at some points in both first half as well as second half but overall a out and out action flick with suprise elements and terrific perfomers. Aniruth travels us with his music throughout the film with efficient energy. Overall a satisfied watch.

bijupillai73-1,11 June 2022,Once upon a time...there lived a Ghost!,"So much excitement for VIKRAM. Based on a character of the same name from the 1986 movie VIKRAM who was a RAW Agent.The basic story here goes as Amar (Fahad) and his team of Black Squads take up the case of high-profile murders (serial killings) that eventually leads them to Santhanam (Vijay Sethupathi), a drug lord and the ""Ghost"", realizing that everything isn't what it seems to be! It's all out guns and glory from then on!The buzz for VIKRAM was there for a few years and then picked up momentum when the first teaser was released almost one and half years ago. The first teaser was just that. A tease! Director Lokesh Kanakaraj said in an interview before the release of VIKRAM that the teaser scenes were just shot to create a buzz among people. It had nothing to do with the actual movie though it gave us a taste of how the movie would be. The excitement peaked while watching with an audience comprising mostly of Tamilians and a some Malayalis. Hoots, Whistles, Cheers, Claps....it was a wild ride on and off screen. It was great to see that both Tamilians and Malayalis shouted out for both Malayalam and Tamil actors alike. No discrimination. Pure love for the actors. Just euphoria!This is one of the most stylish mass action thriller movies out there now and it has incited mass hysteria among the audience as well! One of Lokesh's best. Though his ""Maanagaram"" will always be my favorite. Followed by ""Kaithi."" Kaithi was a ground breaking gangster movie, so fast paced, almost shot completely at night, on the road, out and out action with a sentimental thread of a father and daughter yearning to meet each other. Actor Karthi was awesome as Dilli. Now those who haven't watched ""Kaithi"", must check it out as it too has connections with this new VIKRAM. You can say Lokesh is creating his own cinematic universe, the LKCU or LCU! He has created a script that makes VIKRAM an extension of the movie ""Kaithi."" VIKRAM is one of those rare movies that has stayed true to its genre and trailers. You watch the trailer, you get an idea of what you will be watching and you get exactly that and more with utmost satisfaction. That is quite rare nowadays, as most trailers pump you up but the movie fizzles out! Some scenes remind you of a Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez/Martin Scorcese (Scorcese is one of Lokesh's favourite Hollywood Director) style of movie making which is not bad at all because it results in visually stunning action scenes and set pieces. The movie has some of the most gruesome and creative kills and gore for an Indian movie! With excellent cinematography by our very own Girish Gangadharan, who is also a National Film Award winner for Best Cinematography for the 2019 film ""Jallikkattu"", which itself is an insanely beautiful/magical world captured on camera! Visually, Jallikattu was an immersive experience! Expected nothing less from LJP, the magician! Girish Gngadharan is also famous for his 11 minute single long take for the climax of the movie ""Angamaly Diaries"", another LJP movie.Coming to the actors, Fahad Fazil is no stranger to intense characters. His Black Squad agent Amar, is sharp, dedicated and cold blooded as well. His difficulty in maintaining a love life while keeping the nature of his job a secret, seems so genuine. The one who acts with his eyes, Fahad is in every way the perfect agent to step into Kamal's shoes, if ever the story takes that route. Fahad, as always is terrific in his role. Probably a cake walk for him. Both Fahad and Kamal has those intense eyes that tell us a million stories with one look. Kamal Haasan is back after a hiatus of almost 4 years. Vishwaroopam 2 was his last outing and it didn't do too well at the box office. Kamal once again proves why he is called ""Ulaga Nayagan"" (Universal Hero). At 67, he reprises his Secret Agent role from the 1986 movie VIKRAM. 36 years later! Though it's not ground breaking acting (not needed here) like some of his older famous characters, the moment he enters the picture, right from the beginning of the movie with the song ""Pathala Pathala"", you are mesmerized. When Kamal cries in a certain scene, you feel it too. Once upon a time, there lived a Ghost! Who is the Ghost? I'm not saying anything!Vijay Sethupathi seemed to be having a lot of fun as drug kinkpin Santhanam. A recent drug bust rattles him up and he needs to find and get it back. (This is connected to the movie, Kaithi). And that is all I will say about that! But Vijay Sethupathi was also terrific. Pretty much straight forward bad guy with certain unique nuances (a joy to watch) and a sudden jolt of power inducing drug that he pops into his system in times of need! Kalidas Jayaram had a minor role and he performed well. Surya as Rolex in a cameo role (around 5 mins) stunned everyone! He was fire on screen which resulted in the audience screming out at the top of their lungs for his mind blowing performance. Terror personified! Narain as Bejoy, also reprises his character from ""Kaithi"" and did his part well. Chemban Vinod Jose as Police Chief is also good. Vasanthi is a name and actress to look out for. I can't say anything else about that. üòÉ Post intermission there are a few big twists and reveals that we never see coming! Never! And they are all done so well, so smooth! The 2h 26m runtime feels like a breeze! Kudos to Editor Philomin Raj. Spectacular editing as the movie is quite fast paced. Music Director Anirudh Ravichandran could be considered as a hero of the movie as well because if it wasn't for his music/bgm, VIKRAM would never be elevated to this level! What a badass backgroud score! Even when it's not about action on screen. It is already my new ringtone! The title track, incorporating the ""Vikram Vikram"" theme from the original 1986 movie is outstanding. As well as the melodius number ""Porkanda Singham..."" ""Pathala Pathala"" is a fun song to watch, though I am not a big fan of that one. Whenever there is a scene where Kamal has to walk towards or away from the screen, the Vikram.... Vikram...title song pops up and it's goosebumps!! Wow! Action by Anbariv , the stunt choreographer duo Anbu & Arivu is a class apart. Creative, unique and violent at times. There are certain action scenes that we have never seen before! Awesome!Lokesh is a Kamal fanboy and this is his fanboy moment. But what differentiates him from others is that inspite of all these 3 acting powerhouses together, it is still a Lokesh Kanakaraj movie. He did not have to conform to the mega stars' image! Which is exactly why the movie, BEAST didn't work as it should have! Lokesh has set the groundwork for a new cinematic universe with more sequels in the pipeline. Next could be Kaithi-2 or a Vikram-3 or both! After watching Vikram, thinking about the possibility of Karthi, Kamal, Fahad and Surya together in one movie peaks my interest so much! There are so many stories to be told, so many angles to be thought of! Kamal already hinted at a full fledged movie with Surya and him together. Awesome! Kamal, Fahad and Vijay Sethupathi played their roles to perfection.VIKRAM is a well designed ode to Kamal Haasan. A kick-ass, adrenaline-fuelled ode that deserves the blockbuster label it is now garnering.Watch VIKRAM in cinemas to get the full effect of a mass action movie. But brush up on Kaithi too before that. Enjoy!",9/10,Vikram
navendu_krishnan,5 June 2022,a good watch in 2022,"Saw Vikram yesterdayIts a good movie with edge of the seat entertainment.However I must say Kaithi remains the best of Lokesh Kanagaraj,Vikram can be titled as Fahad fasil in Vikram, because most of the time the story revolves around Fahad fasil, Kamal hassan has lesser screen time even below Chemban VinodStory is neatly written and excecated, it got lot of grip in Interval , Climax scenes, Cinematography is excellent as well as costume selection, Kamal hassan had best costumes which makes him fit and neat.Sentiments portions, Songs were lagging phase.Fahad fasil, Chemban vinod and all other supporting casts acted very well. Vijay sethupathi became a clich√©d villain hence didnt felt like a good act.There were some scenes which makes the audience stupid like Why kamal had to act as a bad guy infront of Kalidas' wife, Vijay sethupathi's family history (not sure why it was added), Vasanthi (agent Tina's) fight scene - she was asking to call kamal many times where she couldve called in first place,It took 10 minutes where they said regarding 3 km to reach at the end but fahad fasil managed to save the kid and appear from nowhere at the end within seconds.Surya's villain role went well but the motive remains clich√©d, just to show he is the main villain the usual villain gimmick called ""kill the gang member who brought the bad news"" is applied.Like these there are many flaws and dumb scenes, however for a flick which entertains us, Vikram is enough.This movie got a long run time around 2 hours and 50 minutes, hence we can feel that at the end many scenes were cut short.If a regular movie buff who watched Better call saul, nobody, accountant, Dark night - can make out many scenes literally copied from thoseLike underground lab from Better call saul
black squad from nobody
safe house scenes from accountant
ending scenes from dark nightBottom line - a good watch in 2022
Its coming in hotstar incase if you miss it in theatre.",7/10,Vikram
krishnamoorthy-57934,3 June 2022,the ghost is back,"Kamal and feasible prove themselves. Well kamal done it already. But did it again. Background music is good and choreography also done properly. Only drawback is it's length of the movie. I think it's long scene for hero introduction scene and fight scenes. Otherwise movie pakka. Worth watching for movie lovers.

AdityaShankar0901,15 July 2022,Sure entertainer but nothing great,"The movie is about series of mysterious murders and it's connection to drug rackets run by 'Rolex' (set in the same universe as Kaithi) (spoiler free synopsis)The first half is better than the second half according to me. I came here looking for a suspense movie and the first half provided exactly that. Second half was all about loud stylized action, just like KGF or Pushpa.In the first half, the audience learn about characters by observing their actions and decisions. Not much is told but shown. Kamal's character and background is shrouded in mystery though. This is evident from the trailer (which too, thankfully, didn't reveal anything!)However, there are small hidden details (easter eggs) to look out for, and references to Kaithi and Kamal's previous films are fanboy moments for die hard fans. The film expects the audience to be attentive to detailThere are also some brilliantly shot scenes, revealing them would be a spoiler! Cinematography and Action Choreography join hands, are in sync, and they're way better than other films of the same genre. The songs are placed properly and don't feel like break from the plot.The story and screenplay is way too old and clich√© to be called good. This is just a massala commercial film with better suspense, cinematography, detailed action than other films of the same genre.",6/10,Vikram

The last 50 minutes of the movie is the highlight of the movie. If there were no last 50 minutes in the movie, then the movie would be a flop. The last 50 minutes of the movie saved the movie from being flop. Kamal Hasan's performance is good. Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and everyone else's performance is good. Background music is the best. This background music made each scene very special and turned it into gold. Completely action movie. The cameo scene of the last suriya was powerful. The length of the movie could be reduced a bit. Minimum 10 to 15 minute scenes could be cut from the movie. Looking forward to the next movie in this series.

The writing here was weak. They were desperately trying to make a connection with ""kaithi"". And grandfather-grandson connection lead to some weird shots. Surya's cameo was fine. But overall the 2nd half was a mess.

jasphoton,14 July 2022,Cringefest 2022,"The movie was a waste of time watching. Went in with too much expectations only to be disappointed by cliche tamil movie shortcomings. The villains all graduated from storm trooper school of shooting. The side characters were brushed aside for the kill count like it was a horror movie. Plot Armor always prevents Vikram (Kamal) from getting 1 shot by villains despite his abysmal stealth and defence. Kamal was probably undercover Hulk, can just one hit KO opponents with a single punch despite being a 60 year old grandpa. It was unrealistic to the core and the explosion/demolition CGI was worse than video games made in 2000s.The plot too was repetitive. Lokesh Kanagaraj already did Master with the similar plot of dealing with a drug dealer antagonist. It also casted some characters from this movie in it. Still Kanagaraj shamelessly claims that his movies are a part of a connected universe. How can a single universe have same people with different identities at the same time (like Sandhanam and Bhavani)? Vikram's fake Big Boss accent was infuriating to hear. People don't speak like a megatron in real life.Tl;Dr this movie was a tamil Michael Bay movie. It was a lot of explosions and no logic. Kamal Haasan once said ""Kathai ya araiya koodathu"". Now I understand why he said so. Because otherwise tamil movie industry won't be able to sell its movies.",1/10,Vikram

Dolchi,3 June 2022,Not for family audience,"As many Kamal Haasan fans are now as old or older than him, initial excitement was about watching this with their family (kids/grandkids). Alas, the swearing in the trailer signalled that this is not to be watched with parents. The movie is for the new generation maybe, not for everyone...One can digest only so many ""build-up"" scenes before yawning and ultimately, having more stars builds even more hype. Yet, the lack of emotional depth fizzes away any reason to continue watching this frivolous attempt. In short, this could be a political wagon for the centrists if one keeps in mind the songs like ""Por kanda singam"" (""Battle-experienced Lion""). With lyrics stereotyping the slum dwellers of Chennai, I'm not sure how many more battlefields this acting king can dance in. (""Aandavar"" = ""Ruler"" ? What was ruled in real life?) Good luck, go educate your kids instead of teaching unbridled violence in the name of vigilantism or self-appointed championing of justice.If you liked this, good for you!! Stop pushing everyone to watch this just cause you want a Tamil film to beat KGF/Baahubali/Dangal in collections.. PeaceThe annoying loudness of the fans is comparable to pointlessly excessive violence and bloodshed in the film itself.. For non-fanboys, the three hour length of the film is a minus pointWith a lacklustre screenplay and acting/characterisation without nuances, we cannot expect any Oscars for this film. Maybe fans as mindless as this film will make this run in the theaters.",2/10,Vikram
aakashr-62197,14 June 2022,I honestly want my money back,"The suspension of disbelief never really kicked in because most of the scenes (be it fight or even the logical sequence of events) were highly unrealistic.The alleged fan moments of Kamal fell really flat, the plot line was very poor, the film could have trimmed to 2hrs and still you would not have missed any details of the plot.

thesillysaint,4 June 2022,Class-Mass Entertainer - Nothing Distinct,"Everyone are applauding the movie for many reasons, let me be neutral on every aspect.Story is nothing new, Screenplay is the hero and the way the director tried to connect his other movie is commendable, hope the sequel will give us all a proper idea as to why he connected that movie to this.Major roles could have been done by any other actor, one character that stood out and can't be replaced is Fahadh Fasil. Kamal has done his part very well, no blame, but there is very less acting scope for an actor like Kamal - but a pure class-mass movie (the kind of entertainer that major audience would love).Dialogues and Background score are another major factor that we could not feel the hassle of watching a 3 hr long movie.One - Liner: Its definitely a high octane action movie but not an actor's movie.",8/10,Vikram
EvanoOruvan,3 June 2022,Couldn't take my eyes off the screen for one second..,"With a stellar cast, director has handled everyone in a extraordinary way and has given equal space to all. Its kamal sir's show all the way. Several twists and surprise elements are present including the climax. Fahad fazil has done an excellent job. To be honest , this is his first better exposure in a Tamil movie..To understand the movie better, please watch Vikram (1986) and kaithi movie.. Its an cinematic universe comprising these two movies..

nishasuperboy,28 April 2022,A must watch,"The characters in this film are solid, each and everyone nailed it to the core. The first half starts a bit confusing but later it catches up the pace once Suraj appears on the screen, to an extent he stole the show with a decent interval bang. The second half of the film is terrific, Prithviraj was just tremendous. The last 45 minutes of the movie are an absolute treat with lots of enormous twists and turns. More than all that this film discusses the current political situation in India and most events that take place in this movie is based on true incidents. A film that I personally believe that should be watched at least once.

arungeorge13,3 June 2022,Tries to counter marginalization with loudness! [+57%],"The film asks some pertinent questions and presents its politics fairly well, but the writing (which goes the over-expository route) and the generic cinematic styles employed make it a somewhat middling affair. Everything in the film is dialed to eleven, especially when it comes to lengthy monologuing. I felt the director took way too much time to make a certain character's death look like a big deal and then struggled to put the twists and backstories across with conviction. When around forty-five minutes of the film remained, I wondered how the makers were planning to change my mind about a certain opinion it presented in the first half, especially with Prithviraj's loud lawyer character going bonkers.While they managed to cover up some of the larger potholes, it wasn't the most easy drive. The narrative often feels disjointed, switching between ""okay"", ""wow"", and ""meh"". The character of Saba (played by a miscast Mamta), whom the film majorly revolves around, is conceived in broad strokes - virtuous, upright, and almost saintly. Suraj adds one more to his list of restrained, grey-shaded performances while Prithvi simply roars his way through the second half. The extended climax, which packs too much information about the sequel, could've been replaced with a subtle tease. But that's the fundamental issue with the film - it revels in its talkathons, its expositions, its overplays.",6/10,Jana Gana Mana
Jithindurden,28 April 2022,Important and probably gonna be contraversial,"The second film by Dijo Jose Antony and he has improved a lot. But one of the things that can be noticed in his first feature Queen itself is that he wants to talk about important things and let the emotion of it spread to the audience and it should be conveyed to every single one of them. He's ready to sacrifice some logic and reality for these emotions. He makes it a point to present these issues on the nose and as dramatic as possible. Queen became a big commercial success for such a small movie even though the critics saw all the problems that were definitely in it. But still, it can't be denied how successful it was at what it set out to be.Jana Gana Mana works very similarly in that regard. There are many points in the film which are exaggerated just for the dramatic effect and unless you are able to be accepting the emotional side and not the real world logic, especially in the courtroom scenes, the movie will be a disappointment.Despite all these issues, the movie is grounded in almost every other aspect. The top-notch acting, specifically by the two leads and the plot itself makes it a compelling watch. Touching upon all the important issues faced by the common people in the country, touching too many nerves due to which the movie ended up banned in a lot of North Indian states, the movie is a bold statement about the state of the country.The way the movie moved through the two protagonists through the two halves was very cleverly done so that the paradigm shift really allows the audience to see the broader picture. The way they made the audience root for things is really commendable as it shows exactly how the world works and why it shouldn't be that way. The movie is made in a way so that its messages can be reached everywhere and also makes sure to teach them to be able to question things. For a movie that is gonna be labelled as something that doesn't consider the audience intelligent enough to comprehend everything unless spelt out, it makes the exact case of why the audience around the world isn't really collectively intelligent and even those who ask for the intelligent narration won't be able to deny those facts.There would be a kind of hate that would be easily faced by this movie. The way the movie dealt with those political aspects is enough for the filmmakers to be proud about it due to the truth in the fiction.",7/10,Jana Gana Mana

nidhunmoviebuff,28 April 2022,Prithviraj & Suraj captivate in this massy political thriller,"Young gun Dijo Jose Antony is only one film old in the Malayalam film industry but managed to give new meaning to the campus movie genre with his debut effort ""Queen (2018)"", which, despite featuring a fresh cast of newcomers, managed to smartly blend college life with a strong social message and the thrills of a legal procedural. In ""Jana Gana Mana"" the director has established stars to work with and leverages them to the best possible extent, delivering a strong, message-oriented thriller that balances massy moments with unexpected twists to keep the audience hooked for its entirety.""Jana Gana Mana"" arrived in theatres having already veered delectably off the beaten path, having released its teaser and trailer with scenes not from the movie but from its upcoming sequel, in what is surely a first of its kind promotional stunt in world cinema. The trailer especially featured a 4-minute awe-inspiring one-shot action sequence that had captured the imagination of Malayali audiences and it was with this burden of expectations that the movie premiered across screens worldwide today.We follow the story of ACP Sajjan, played by the ever-dependable National Award winner Suraj Venjaramoodu, who is assigned the sensational case of the brutal murder of a college professor who was adored by her students and was known for her staunch political stands. As the student protests build due to political interference and constant hurdles being placed in the investigation, the case moves to a tense courtroom drama, where the pace becomes breakneck, and the stakes become monumental.Despite a sluggish first half laced with some cringe-worthy moments of excess melodrama and misplaced songs, the introduction of Prithviraj's character and the inflexion points in the plot at the onset of the second half more than makes up for it. Vincy Aloshious is especially on-point in her supporting role as a student leader while Pasupathy Raj, Mamtha Mohandas, GM Sundar and Shari also deliver convincing performances. Jakes Bejoy's background score is a rousing companion to the narration throughout the length of the film, providing emotion and stimulation in equal measure, making the punch dialogues whistle worthy and generating goosebumps in the mass elevation scenes.Prithviraj and Suraj Venjaramoodu deliver another brilliant lead-duo combination hit after the blockbuster ""Driving License (2019)"", albeit with few scenes together. With a lingering promise of more back-and-forth between these two captivating actors in the sequel, I can't wait to see how their sparkling chemistry is carried forward. Without giving too much away about Prithviraj's character, he is enigmatic and powerful in equal measure and delivers strong messages about many of the societal evils we are facing in the world around us.The plot of the movie would have seemed ludicrous about 5 years ago but having seen and heard about incidents like the 2020 Jawaharlal Nehru University Attacks and false-flag operations and co-ordinated cyber-attacks deliberately set up by governments to sway voters as elections approach, truth is stranger than fiction in the world we live in today where right-wing fundamentalists have overrun our polity and have made extraconstitutional and extrajudicial decisions their second nature. While the messaging tends to get a bit loud and the storyline is sometimes spoonfed to the audience without much subtlety, one can forgive the makers as such is the importance of the messages they are trying to put out with this earnest project.The director and writer Sharis Mohammed deserve all the praise in the world for performing a magician's sleight of hand in the final act of the film, ending this tantalizing first instalment on a knife-edge, with the unsaid promise of making the franchise a genre-bending, era-defining duology, With the trailer and the teaser apparently giving us only a glimpse of what Dijo, Prithviraj and this kickass team have planned for us in the second instalment, the anticipation is clearly through the roof as to what they will come up with, without the shoot restrictions enforced by Covid that they had to circumvent for the first part. ""Jana Gana Mana"" is a mandatory theatre watch that should open the doors to braver, more political thrillers in the future for Malayalam cinema! Recommended!",8/10,Jana Gana Mana
magadalwarmayur,28 April 2022,Important film but with lots of flaws,"The film tries to speak about various issues in the society about biases, dividing etc but the approach is very loud the film goes overdramatic far too often.But despite its right intent and partly interesting structure, the making is quite uneven. Much of the treatment is loud and over-dramatic, especially the court scenes in the latter half. While it meanders pointlessly in the initial campus scenes, too much is said in quite a few rushed sequences towards the end. Much of this has to do with the mystery around Prithviraj's character, who re-appears only at the interval point, after an introduction in the prologue. The script also banks on all the incessant talking that this character does, not only to convey its political ideas, but also to reveal the twists in the tale.A decent watch nonetheless.

indianature,22 June 2022,Nothing Is What It Appears To Be,"Watched JGM on Netflix in orig. Malayalam w/Eng. Subs. Several audio portions are in multiple languages like Tamil / English / Kannada.10 Stars for the important, disturbing mainstream current issues that are ""loudly"" propounded by Prithviraj as Adv. Aravind in the courtroom scenes ... with the 7-8 star rider that the courtroom scenes are far removed from actual courtroom reality! This is not important if you watch the film as fiction as indeed the Disclaimer proclaims. Nowadays one is used to expecting heavy doses of realism in Malayalam films so in that sense the courtroom scenes are a deviation.JGM is a crime thriller that starts with a murder of a lady professor. The narration has multiple layers veering towards the convoluted and nothing is prima facie what it appears to be.I was a tad confused with so many languages in the orig. Audio. In my understanding the film is set in Bangalore where Tamil and Malayalam are also commonly spoken.As its a thriller, it would not be right in this review to spoil the suspense for other viewers. Suffice it to say that the film is very watchable and rivetting especially once the courtroom dramatics begin.",8/10,Jana Gana Mana

M_D_V,20 June 2022,Packed With Great Performances of lead Characters and Gripping screenplay.,"Firstly, I absolutely loved the film. I was curious about the project when i saw its's First teaser, later by looking at the trailer i was little bit surprised and shocked at the same time. Wanted to see how the film is and how this film gonna works in the boxoffice. Unfortunately i couldn't watch movie in Theatre, i was waiting for its digital release and i heard positive response about the film so it made me more excite about the film. After watching it, i can say is that this film exceeded all my expectations. While watching this i was so loving the dialogues of the film whatta dialogues man just superb and hard-hitting. This movie hook me from it's very first scene in which Prithviraj Sukumaran looks at someone's face ,treat to watch the way he does that.(before talking his performance lets talk about the film's first half )In the first half of the film especially before the court scene starts Suraj Venjaramoodu as ACP Sajjan performed Effortlessly, till the court drama starts his performance made me to watch, he performs very subtly. And when the court drama starts the movie goes to another level by Prithviraj Sukumaran's performance, twists and in which direction story of the case was going was extraordinary. I was clueless atleast for 15mins about where the story heading towards when the Prithviraj Sukumaran enters into the screen at the end of the first half. Kudos to writing team for giving us such a powerfull dialogues. And closeup shots were treat to watch . Screenplay was so good and never felt slow throughout the film. Which bothered me in this was at the end of the climax where we get to know about Prithviraj Sukumaran's backstory which didn't hit me that hard as much as court room drama ended. Other than that everything was worked really well for me.my rating will be 9.5/10 for this.For movie buffs this is the one to look forward. This film is must watch and waiting for it's sequel...",10/10,Jana Gana Mana
rtoac1,5 June 2022,Another propaganda film,"These days you can't watch a decent Malayalam film without first reading the story. With a deceptive plot they convey a political agenda. And while the film lovers are drooling on the performances and technical parts, the puppeteers behind the film are having a good laugh at them.Subconsciously you push an anti Hindu narrative into the minds of the innocent viewers is the main agenda. Obviously first make them watch the film by putting a nationalist title - like The Great Indian Kitchen or Jana Gana Mana here. Because you know they are nationalists and will come to watch. Then you use the soft targets and manipulate their minds into a self-shaming narrative.Note that the director didn't put this as a story happening within Kerala, even though a Malayalam film - clearly revealing the political agenda.Viewers and those rating such films I hope are smart enough to see through such films and reject them outright.",1/10,Jana Gana Mana
alphadude007,3 June 2022,A commercial flick sans any logic (in court),"Jana Gana Mana is a decent movie for a time pass watch. It definitely does entertain. The movie takes a good hour or so to set up the base premise and then starts unravelling the twist in the story in the second half. The movie tries to address a lot of serious issues, but the entire court scene and the deliberation process was a joke. This was similar to Jyotika's movie ponmagal vandhal, a film where they also make the court scenes a joke. With a bit more prep and consideration the court scene could have been more realistic and make the movie a bit more believable. Also, the extended twist in the end was all jam-packed into the last 10-15 minutes and was super unnecessary. And it would have been great if Prithviraj's and Suraj's roles were reversed. Suraj is a great actor, but he cannot carry such a suavve role. Overall, a decent watch, but could have been much better. And oh, please stop casting Priyanka in movies. Even though she was only here for the last 10 minutes or so, she was horrible. The woman can't act.

cksquare,30 April 2022,Crappy masala movie - illogical and ridiculous,"They wrote a story by including stories from the media.It started with 'Azaadi' like protest from JNU. Then a Hyderabad style rape and murder. Then a police investigation drama. From there a Hyderabad style encounter.Now then the hero walks in as an defence lawyer, who yells in the court makes the judge look like a fool. And the judge even made to squirms in a scene.Hero now repaints everything by making wild unsubstantiated accusations. But then just when you thought it was illogical, somewhere the police office investigating the case actually turns against himself and provides proof!!! WTF !!Then the heroism starts !!Oh my god! What a crap of fabricated twists.Boring enough that I am typing this as I am watching the movie. Oh save me!!Malayalam cinema can do better and has done so too.

This movie is recommended by anti Indians like Rana Ayyub on twitter. You can instantly realise this is a propaganda movie.

Aside from painting one community in poor light, there is nothing that this movie seeks to accomplish. I feel sorry for the producers, that could've actually fed starving children for generations than to support this kaaka thoori stuff.

SAMTHEBESTEST,10 June 2022,"Packs too much content for one film. Yet another powerful exposure of the system, media and social media blue tick holders.","Jana Gana Mana (2022) :
Movie Review -Packs too much content for one film. Yet another powerful exposure of the system, media and social media blue tick holders. Malayalam cinema is ruling content classes in India like no other cinema industry, especially in the last 2 years. These exposure dramas are being made in heavy numbers down south, and I am not at all hesitant to admit the fact from the north here. Jana Gana Mana is yet another powerful speech-maker with too much hard-hitting content for one narrative, but that's the USP here. It might have taken 2-3 films to congregate multiple issues and concepts, but this film does it alone within 160 minutes. It is a social drama, it is an investigation drama, it is a cop drama, it is a courtroom drama, and last but not least, it is a thriller too, and a great one. By the interval point, you have no idea what's gonna happen next, nor do you even have any clues about the characters. That's how much it has to offer despite the long runtime. And let me tell you, it doesn't end there. Take Prithviraj Sukumaran's character, for instance. He doesn't even have one proper scene until the first half. On the other hand, Suraj Venjaramoodu had a strong presence in the first half but very little in the second half. And then he takes charge again in the climax - only to surprise you. What a lovely screenplay it is. So much to learn for other writers and so much to experience as a viewer. That human rights officer's scene when Aravind tells her about her social media post - Wow, man. How did the writers come up with such fantastic thoughts when it was of the utmost importance to expose those blue tick holders in today's social media era? I hope this brings change in the social media world and our internet generation learns from it. The crime angle is so well crafted and versed with the ideology of the common man about the system, media, so-called socialists, and cops. Overall, a must-see. That's all.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7/10,Jana Gana Mana
bkvora,6 June 2022,Dalit Opression Fantasy,"My review has spoilers !!!The Acting of Suraj Venjaramoodu is the Hallmark of this movie for which I have given a rating of 6. There is a lot of exaggeration of Dalit Opression. There is a University that does not give PhD to Dalit's. Come on. Where did this come from. A Malyalam movie where all the problems of Government are due to Central Government. The Story appears exaggerated & not believable.All the villains have tika's on their forehead & all other faiths are good people. Give me a break. This is Leftist propaganda at the fullest.Normally I am a big fan of Malyalam movies. This one can be skipped as it definitely has a strong Political bias that is not only untrue but also not believable.Once again, excellent acting by Suraj Venjaramoodu. If you want to watch this movie, watch it for him.",6/10,Jana Gana Mana

Bioscoper,4 June 2022,One sided Agenda movie,"Cannot expect malayalam movies to be clean ? Why does it always have to have a political agenda ? This is very sad to observe that conflicts sell, divisive movies make money & showing a country on fire can be acceptable ? It's a shameful content & everyone should watch it with utmost prejudice. These things disrupt peace & raise a lot of questions. Showing NDTV in the initial scenes itself was a self goal attempt.

MovieBuff02,4 June 2022,Too many plot holes + an unrealistic & convoluted storyline,"The movie starts off on a high albeit confusing note. The start of the movie tries to strike a note with the viewer by making it look like a social issue drama but then agonizingly slowly takes a turn to a complicated conspiratorial-style plot which has just too many gaps. The story lacks in its research or was deliberately made so for the drama and mass appeal.Possibly one of the worst legal/crime dramas I've watched this year!

The movie asks a lot of thought provoking questions and will leave you thinking when you come out of the theatre. It leaves a socially relevant message in a very methodically written script. Try not to politicize the movie as there is a long disclaimer in the beginning mentioning that all the characters and the story are fictional. Watch the movie for the message they are trying to convey. It's a must watch for all Indians!

Telugu/tamil movies are scoring good nowadays. Like RRR etc.Mollywood, please do not fall for woke crap like the Hollywood did. I advise you to wait for the OTT. It doesn't deserve your hard earned money on theater.

wishformusic,3 June 2022,Outdated cliche with typical Prithviraj elements,"My thought of Jana Gana Mana: Terrible 1st half. Slow, boring, unnecessary songs, the list goes on. The second half feels like a pathetic attempt to climb back from the deep pit.Nearly all actors have overacted. The only people who have acted in a restrained and convincing way are the villains and the girl portraying Vidya.Looks like the story and screenplay were written by a child. An unrealistic imagery of court procedures.Novice direction.Loaded with flavours typical to Prithviraj movies like pseudo love for muslims, anti-hindu sentiment, bad politicians, twisted media, pseudo communism, an ending showing the hero has a past bigger than the character he played during the rest of the movie (e.g: Sapthamasree, Lucifer...), and a suggestion of a sequel no one wants to see. Yawn! Time for a dump.Reasonable cinematography and quality of editing, the only silver lining in an otherwise mediocre clich√© flick.Overall score: 2.5/10.",2/10,Jana Gana Mana
alansenmonofficial-14681,1 May 2022,THE QUALITY OF A MALAYALAM MOVIE PROVED AGAIN..,"The main positive of the movie is it's content, brilliantly written and executed.The performances of Vincy, pritviraj, Suraj and all other actors were incredible. There were so much moments were we will get goosebumps.The bgm, cinematography and all other technical aspects were another huge positive of the movie
these aspects took the movie into another level.The director the writer and the whole team had a complete vision on how this movie should come out and now it has.The movie deals with very socially relevant issues addressing them questioning them through the magic of the movie, on the other hand the movie is also a big success on keeping the audience engaged till the end.Only one word for this one "" EXTRAORDINARY "".",7/10,Jana Gana Mana

gaathakalyani,25 June 2022,Could have been better,"Movie gave an 'okay' experience to me. I liked the making quality and performances. Camera work is also appreciable. But my doubt is that whether the movie could completely convey what it was meant to be. Is Saying every issue in a single sentence and merely touching the surface of every societal issues and just shouting with maas dialogues enough to have an impact on the socital status? And I'm so irritated that, I felt they have covered some aspects. When they show discriminations happening around, they are having an interest to categorize it as a classism.but actually it is casteism. It is the evil responsible for every single discrimination going on around us today. The discrimination on financial ups and downs actually arises from the caste based thoughts in people. Many times I could feel this was not clearly spoken. And when they talk about color based discrimination in primary textbooks, they have shown a light skinned hero and a dark skinned villain. When they convey that the politician was trying to play with the emosions of the public, the film does the same thing with audience. They are trying just to make the audience thrilled with super class dialogues and many times were forgetting the motive . I felt it very obvious in the court scenes. They were such dramatic ones portraying everyone including the judge watching a lawyer conducting his lengthy speech with nothing to say infront of him. The movie could have been better if they have shown some more responsibility. While handling such a topic, it is to be made sure that the motive is held close to the heart throughout. At many instances I felt, was the movie just shrinking to its commercial shell. Anyway movie was engaging. But fact is, it could have been better in its way of conveying the theme.",6/10,Jana Gana Mana
cool_andhot,6 June 2022,A politically correct thriller gem,"When you think Malayalam movie Industry had already touched all the subjects, they keep coming with relevant great movies. This movie will make your blood boil and then slowly soothes you with some awesome dialogues and amazing court scene. Some twists on the way will make you question your own prejudices towards our Indian society. This movies is much needed for our society. Normally I don't recommend Bollywood to remake and ruin any movies. But this movie will be a good remake with the right director and cast and can reach to maximum people. No bhakths or Sanghis were harmed while making this film.

RECOMMENDEDMovie has lot of powerful dialogs and point blank questions to society and media. I was clapping alone in home, while watching for the second half dialogs.The first half is so average and the second half is too good. The Second half seems so illogical and too dramatic, but the end twist made forget everything.The serious tone, the confusion in first half and overdramatic court scenes are big minus. Still the cast, acting and climax surpass the mistakes in the writings.Must watch.

cs_rahul_kumar,20 July 2022,Jana Gana Mana Unveils the Politics of Fake Encounters !!!,"A college lecturer gets killed and her body is burnt, and the incident leads to a massive public outcry. Police officer Sajjan Kumar is in charge of booking the culprits, and his attempts to execute the same isn't as simple as any regular investigation. The film shows who the real criminals behind the act are and how their ploys get unmasked.Cold-blooded murders masked as police encounters aren't a novelty in our country, and such are also often glorified as 'instant justice.' In Dijo Jose Antony's Jana Gana Mana, starring Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu in the lead, the makers show why and how fake encounters are doing a disservice to the society and how politicians manipulate our 'emotions' through the same.Director Dijo Jos Antony had earlier claimed that Jana Gana Mana does not project a political stance. However, the Prithviraj starrer reminds viewers of some tragic incidents that had major political repercussions. From the death of Rohith Vemula in University of Hyderabad that ignited discussions about the wretched casteism prevailing in India's premier educational institutions, to rape cases, to the recent encounter killings of accused rapists in Hyderabad, Jana Gana Mana has touched upon many relevant political topics, all through a lengthy courtroom sequence.Before the title is shown, we see Prithviraj's character Aravind Swaminathan being escorted by policemen from the court to a jail and we get a sense that the character has a turbulent past. However after the title is shown, the movie follows an entirely different storyline starting with the murder of a professor named Saba Mariam (Mamta Mohandas) who teaches in a Central University in Hyderabad. The next day's newspaper claims that Saba was brutally raped and murdered which becomes sensational news, and her students start an agitation demanding a fair enquiry into the murder. To divert viewers or to fit in more political elements, the Vice Chancellor of the University plays the 'religion card' by saying Saba is from a particular community and 'these' people can be identified by the way they look and dress. This further agitates the students and suddenly one student leader, who by her name is Hindu, wears her shawl over head to show solidarity with the Muslim community. This act might be an inspiring moment for many, but it reeks of privilege.The film is definitely influenced by many real-life incidents, especially the 2019 Hyderabad gang rape case and the 'extrajudicial execution' that followed the incident. It shows what exactly is the problem with the police breaking the law through these actions, how each of us are conditioned to pass judgements on people merely based on how they look or what they wear, the misplaced public sentiments in favour of such executions and why they shouldn't be celebrated... all of them, through a well-knit story. Political parties have long been using police vigilantism as a tool to manipulate people's emotions and bank on them to gain votes, and it needs to be appreciated how a mainstream Malayalam movie, starring top actors, is discussing the issue in an engaging manner. Both Suraj and Prithviraj Sukumaran have done abundant justice to their respective roles, and the crew behind the film also deserves applause aplenty, for boldly narrating such a relevant story on screen. If a rape happens in this country every 15 minutes and we are only shocked about just a few of them, who is to be blamed? Why does someone's death matter more than someone else's? The movie explains well why we react how we do, and the hypocrisy behind it.Coming back to the movie, the agitated students are brutally beaten up by the police and the case is handed over to a high-ranking police officer named Sajjan Kumar, played by Suraj Venjaramoodu. Sajjan takes over the case and regains the trust of students and the public through a fair investigation. Within days he finds the culprits behind Saba's murder. However, due to lack of evidence and pressure from above, Sajjan is removed from the case. Before he leaves the case, he shoots down the four convicts in a fake encounter which is celebrated by the public and media. The second half is set in a courtroom where Prithviraj arrives as Aravind Swaminathan and reveals the truth about Saba's death. In the courtroom, Prithviraj's Aravind asks all the questions that has shaken the democratic spirit of this country - from Rohith Vemula's death to tribal Madhu's murder in Kerala.Coming to the performances, Prithviraj steals the show with his powerful performance as an advocate who asks hard-hitting questions. Suraj Venjaramoodu, as a police officer of many shades, also puts up a convincing performance. There are many characters that come and go in the movie, but none of them are memorable. Mamta also doesn't get much scope to perform.Those who love a good political crime thriller inspired from real-life incidents can feast on Jana Gana Mana, that teaches you to think, question, challenge and more as a common man who consumes news at its face value.",8/10,Jana Gana Mana

And it won't disappoint you.The way they handled the real incident (Not really forget about it) in a completely different dimensional with a convincingly great screenplay should be applauded.Prithviraj stole the show with stunning performance. Suraj did wonders as a cop.This movie literally showed everything that happens today. Managed to genuinely exploit the grey shade of media and how they misuse such a powerful tool for their own. Exploited politicians and campus monsters who would do anything to propel their image or brand.Director's admirable ground work on the script should be appreciated for a big time.Drop whatever you're doing and grab your tickets asap!It ended up as one of the best cinematic experience for me because each and every one of us could easily able to connect with the subject they took up.It's another feather on Prithviraj and suraj's cap.,5/10,Jana Gana Mana

As a college professor's brutal rape & murder sparks student unrest, a cop launches an investigation while a lawyer seeks justice in the courtroom.The first half focuses entirely on the investigation carried out by the police while the second half is a gripping courtroom drama .The twist in the second half is amazing to say the least and nothing is what it seems. The film deals with Police encounter killings, dirty politics, misuse of social media, targeting gullible students by politicians to serve their purpose,Media trials by Television channels to increase their TRPs.Prithviraj Sukumaran as the advocate Aravind and Suraj Venkaramoodu as ACP Sajjan Kumar have both excelled in their roles. Even though Prithviraj appears only in the second half, his role is power packed and he lights the screen on fire with his performance.Strong content, great direction by Dijo Jose Anthony with a social message in the end make it an excellent watch.

Raghuram Iyer takes the place of those stakeholders who plots doctored ideology so as to marginalise, spread hate, and loot profits of power and wealth by manipulating sects with appeasement and separatism to harvest creepy vested interested with much deceit and camouflage, and Adv. Aravind Swaminathan is not yet emerged but much to be desired persona who is yet to emerge in todays political scenario to crusade against the evil odds happening around. Except some rebellion sudent characters who either under/overplayed, still does not bring any harm to its wholeness. This is indeed a pan indian rather pan international discipline. It underscores the worst harms that doctored narratives can do in todays world. This is antidote to propoganda flicks that has done enough damage already.

ritesh657,3 June 2022,"Striking, Hard-Hitting, and Thought-Provoking.","Jana Gana Mana is an extremely hard-hitting and shockingly brilliant crime drama. Astounding performances by the entire cast, remarkable screenplay, and powerhouse direction are some of the main highlights throughout the film. Prithvj's monologues and that poignant finale are worthy of any shortcomings you may nit-pick throughout the film. Overall a striking and thought-provoking film that is highly recommended.Prithviraj's character arc gradually shifts from being tragic to a stage where he triumphs and this man excels with flying colors through his performance. Suraj Venjaramood's performance is as significant as Prithvi's and he delivers always. The plot shift and twists are handled so well that you sink into your seats when they reveal themselves. An emotional finale is bound to give you some goosebumps. If hard-hitting and gripping crime drama is something you like, then Jana Gana Mana straight away should be on your watchlist.

realnandhagopal,22 June 2022,A must watch,"This is how a movie should be, director often pulls the audience towards a certain direction and then denys the same with brutal reality and honest logics yeah people will get offended as it disturbs their core logics that's what a success means to a film like this the ones who follows meh social medias with cringe passion are the ones who are gonna likely get offended by this.

kmsdeen,23 May 2022,Message boldly conveyed,"Very relevant to present day when irrelevant and poisonous articles create a frenzy in social media. Appreciate the team in taking the first step boldly. Could be even better.Prithvi's performance is outstanding. He got the powerful character with powerful words. Equally powerful is Suraj's character who performed really well.Sequence of events keeps up the pace. No drag felt in the entire movie.Congratz to entire team for boldly conveying spate of events.

At the present scenerio this movie is must watch thriller with lots of twists and turns. Prithviraj and suraj, no words to judge their acting skills. Every actor has played their part.

gokulmadhu-37537,11 June 2022,Blend of Greatness and imperfections,"The movie conveys a great idea, I love the power it has to divert our expectation in every way possible by making us being part of the story itself.Plot twists and character development(or backstory i should say) were really good.The dialogues were often cringy, the pacing inconsistent, some convolution here and there, and a really unrealistic courtroom scene(even though the drama there was the highlight).

krishnan357-33-782579,6 May 2022,Engaging legal and socio-political thriller with a few flaws,"I went into Jana Gana Mana with high expectations because of the reviews. I knew most of the scenes from the trailers were from the second part.I liked the movie a lot. I did feel there were a few flaws and I think I'll get those out of the way.I didn't like the way languages were spoken in the film. Everyone seems to speak Malayalam inspite of the movie being set in Bangalore. Some of the court scenes were a bit silly like Prithviraj randomly calling witnesses without the prosecution completing its witness list.Also, the judge's behaviour was weird. Instead of sustaining objections, he seemed to be questioning Prithviraj's character's motivations.The actions of the VC of the college were also weird considering how they would be perceived by the general public. He publicly slanders a recently murdered faculty in an auditorium. It just seemed to be done to make him a clear villain.Coming to the good parts, the twists were very well done. The acting by pretty much all the characters were top notch.I liked how the movie seemed to support encounter killings initially and then flipped it on its head. Some people were cheering in my theater when the encounter killings happened. Hopefully, they think about how it circumvents due process after watching the movie.I also liked how the media were portrayed in terms of wanting a primetime story above all else and how the truth can get twisted.The ending was great. It definitely made me want to watch the second part.",8/10,Jana Gana Mana
arokiaantony-54515,24 June 2022,If u r a indian you must have to watch this movie..,"This is a really a awesome movie üé•üé•üé• .The characters in this film are solid, each and everyone nailed it to the core. The first half starts a bit confusing but later it catches up the pace once Suraj appears on the screen, to an extent he stole the show with a decent interval bang. The second half of the film is terrific, Prithviraj was just tremendous. The last 45 minutes of the movie are an absolute treat with lots of enormous twists and turns. More than all that this film discusses the current political situation in India and most events that take place in this movie is based on true incidents. A film that I personally believe that should be watched at least once.

veynz1,9 June 2022,"10% fine, 90% wasted opportunity","The trailers were brilliant. The film, sadly, isn't.Had major expectations after seeing the trailers,
but the film is a confused mess.And too loud.The first half dragged on for such a long time, I was thinking, ""Move on now, take us to the court!""
But when the court scenes came, they turned out to be too loud and preachy.Prithviraj has all the right intentions, and is very bold to depict today's scenario but somehow ends up overkilling it. (Kuruthi was another example - brilliant first half, but goes bonkers later).Other negatives?Mamata Mohandas was a total waste. She can't act to save her life (which is fine since she's bumped off).Hated the 'acting' of over-enthu students, especially that girl (don't recollect her name) who was a lesson in overacting.And what's with this constant chant of ""We want justice!""? After a while, it was grating!And then of course, the ending - it was never-ending! All those back and forth scenes of sequel or prequel or God knows what it was.The only scene that I liked was the encounter one (the second time when the entire thing is revealed). That, in spite of the predictability, was pretty tense. Now THAT is the way the entire movie should have played out.My 5 stars are for that scene, the trailers and the Jana Gana Mana song (which wasn't used well btw).",5/10,Jana Gana Mana

Its not against political party like BJP or other ,it's about the corruption which common people has to suffer when it's happens at political and administrative level.if by seeing the film any one conclude that it's against them then you are right,They need to change for good.

itumaesh,8 June 2022,This 10 rating is for Unique 2nd half,"1st half was as usual which we would have visualized with other movies and how they actually start.But unexpectedly, the 2nd half was altogether a different league. 2nd portion comes with bunch of stuffs like hero getting into the screen, his introduction, villain introduction, how does he get trapped in hero's web, whats the reason behind his surrender, twists/turns and there seems to be couple of interesting stories and this movie proves the importance of having a director on board on how he interconnects these couple of interesting stories makes this as a interesting flick which is not to be missed. Moving forward, will ensure not to miss any of this director's upcoming flicks.

natureboy-84907,1 May 2022,A Notable Anthem,"Freedom for me would always be the movie times and when its time with Malayalam Movies it's something more . That's the case with the movie Jana Gana Mana, this movie has lots of areas to feel cherished , delighted , mesmerised, excited , wowed , thrilled and what not . Like that of our National Anthem this too has lot of ph(ra)ses running for a good length triggering some goosebumps moments, entertaining the movie goers through out and ends with a good note . The choice of storyline, the screenplay by the director and writer is to be well appreciated. The Malayalam movie industry is marching with their heads up miles ahead of many others. JGM has some of the finest performances by Mamta Mohandas , Suraj , Prithviraj, Shari, Vincy and many more . Thanks to them that the movie turned to be so realistic and delightful. It's a KLassy one like many others from the state of KL . Mamta is super pretty acting awesome , Suraj is brilliant and Prithivi rocks. The editor Sreejith needs a mention here for making this a racy political thriller. BGM did enrich the movie to greater levels. On the story , While we conclude that we have cracked the movie , the director delivers a spin with some good twists and turns and gets us out of our assumptions . Living upto the name of the movie, this has got lot of dialogues in Tamil and Kannada as well and the movie is released in other Indian languages as well . The length and inclusion of some contents could have been handled better , close to 3 hrs is little taxing . Overall, Jana Gana Mana, a Notable Anthem .",8/10,Jana Gana Mana

What told in this movie is unfortunately true. It is a sad face of our country and people. I am not speaking about the political stuff as we all know about that .If we come to the movie , it was well scripted. This is an example of a good script. We will not get an inch of what will happen next . The movie will tell us the right things at the right time. Its so thrilling . Prithviraj just nailed it . He is just something. I am eagerly waiting for his future projects because it is the future of Malayalam film industry . It will be a crime if I didn't mention Suraj . Man...simply he is an actor who traveled from one end to another. Also all the young actors were also brilliant especially Vincy Aloshious . It is a wonderful movie and DON'T MISS IT IN THEATERS. Waiting for the second part.

Interestingly, Suraj & Prithviraj brought commanding performances for each half with different reasons.

sriramthestranger,4 November 2022,Good Entertainer!!,"First, the stand out thing is the character plot of Yogi Babu, and his part of story is much much better than the lead pair. The screenplay and editing is racy and kudos to the Director for showing the virtual conversations in a non-boring and engaging way - as majority of the movie is based on that.No characters are 'extra' in the film, and everyone including the dog has a great moment. The editing deserves a special mention for the smart use of switching between split and full screen.Director Pradeep had fully used all his artists and crew to the best potential. And, Yuvan Shankar Raja is the second hero of the movie undoubtedly. Do watch!!

antonyprabu-76208,6 November 2022,Laughter Garunteed with A Little Message Packed Inside!!,"To be honest this movie was not on my list. I have seen the short film years back and I thought there would be nothing much in this movie and I can wait for this movie to be released on an OTT platform. That would have been a serious mistake. 155 minutes of fun ride guaranteed. We were literally on the edge of our seats laughing our hearts out. OMG!! What a Movie. Very good Screenplay and the way Pradeep has developed his short film into a feature film was brilliant. Apart from the fun part there were a lot of take aways for us from the movie. I loved the way they connected the growth of a Tree towards Trust. And Yes, trust is the basic and most important thing when it comes to any relationship and not just love. It's easy to trust a person who is all good with zero flaws. Unfortunately, there is no one in this world without any flaws. We should have an open mind to trust each other and accept them with their differences and flaws. All of us are vulnerable towards something in our life, rather than feeling bad or guilty about it we could work on it towards becoming a better person day by day. If someone leaves you because of a mistake that you have made in your life, Don't feel bad.. It's about whether you confessed with them about it and even after that if they choose to move on, don't hold them back, let them go. They might need time to process everything to get back to you or they might not. Just heal yourself and move on. Again, on the other hand, if someone has taken advantage of your kindness, trust and even after you being honest about your flaws and the mistakes you have done and still if they decide to leave you, Don't hold them back.. Trust me!! It's Hard!! But embrace the pain and move on with a smile. Everyone has the right to make their own choices in life. Sometimes, you might not even know the reason why they left you behind for someone else.. Maybe it's for their own good or any reason. Just Let Go!! You continue to be who you are and someday your life will change too. The person who is meant for you will come to you. If a person really loves you they will stay in your life no matter what, love you more and help you to become a better person in Life. The Others will move towards what's good and best for them. Just wish them the best with whatever choices they have made for them and you fill yourself with positive vibes and surround yourself with people who have similar thoughts. Think Good!! Be Good!!

saru2020,15 November 2022,Best Film on Love,"One of the best films ever made, easily the best film of the year.A must-watch for current-day lovers, especially for the about to get married couples.This is one of those peculiar films which cannot be contained/categorized into a specific genre as it covers a wide variety of areas like love, life, lust, porn, modern love, tech (Climaxed with AI), trust, relationships, philosophy, comedy, current socio-economic conditions, childhood, adulthood, friendship, sisterhood, parenting, etc.Overall, a very nicely packaged well-made presentation.IMO, this is probably the first movie where the emotional arc of the film keeps on rising till the very end like a line drawn at a 45-degree angle on a graph/chart. An emotional roller coaster ride in the climax might bring tears if you're an emotional person.It slightly feels like an SJ Suryah's 2022 film.All actors did play their roles very well, it just felt so natural which gravitates us into their world automagically.U1's songs & BGM did their magic making the soul of the film.It is undoubtedly a must-watch if you like watching films, it'd be worth your time & money for sure.",10/10,Love Today

This film should be a reminder for all that even if it is a simple plot, you can satisfy the audience by how you visualise it and deliver it.yogi babu and sathyaraj has lived the character. Kudos to the team for a delivering such a hilarious, heartwarming and eye opening film.

SAMTHEBESTEST,23 November 2022,"A top-class concept is here to thrash all the mediocre modern love stories. This is how today's love is, and you'll find realism in it.","Love Today (2022) :
Brief Review -A top-class concept is here to thrash all the mediocre modern love stories. This is how today's love is, and you'll find realism in it. Love Today is totally today's concept for a love story as we see a wannabe couple swap phones for a day, which opens many secrets. It's a hilarious film throughout and also tries to be a little sensible at the end. It only lacks one thing, and that's intellectualism. The way it tries too hard to make love win at the end is too mainstream and predictable. Of course, not every film can have mic drop endings like Casablanca or Brief Encounter, but let's say we are 7 decades ahead now, so at least we should feel ashamed of that. One more thing is that the film missed a big chance of becoming a modern lesson for sons and daughters who never listen to their parents when they ask them not to use phones so much. On the personal side, when I see lovers talking to each other on the phone, like for a full day (including my own brother), I always tell myself, ""How can two people talk so much on the same topics every day?"" How are you, had your lunch, what you ate, will bunk classes to meet you, all these things and what not. You spend almost half the day doing this talk on the phone with some stranger whom you've known for a few months, but have you ever spent even 10% of that time asking the same things to your mother or father, with whom you've been living for years? In one scene, Love Today had a chance to shed some light on this thought but missed. That conversation between our hero and his mother could have become a memorable scene with these thoughts, or one more that he should have listened to his mother when she told her not to use the phone so much, and now he realises that a mother is never wrong. Anyway, it's a fantastic film with plenty of laughs and relatable scenes from your own life, so enjoy it. Please note that my phone is always open to anybody for a thorough check. I am that clean!RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7/10,Love Today
arungeorge13,19 November 2022,"Funny indeed, but not as insightful! [+58%]","Love Today is a 155-minute long meme on romances in the social media era. When it's funny, it's laugh-your-guts-out funny. When it's not, it's trying to be a bit messagey - to forego the temporary flailings of the mind, not to give up but to trust and keep going. I'm not sure I dug either of the leads all that much - they're painted with the typical, committed pasanga tropes of the current generation yet hard to get behind. The performances by the leads (Pradeep Ranganathan and Ivana) are also okayish.Ranganathan has a bunch of ideas and he wants every scene to look meme-ish but it works only when he's conceptualizing them inventively (like the ""Instagram episode"") and not simply sticking to the expository male gaze. Yeah, the script is obviously a lot more forgiving towards Pradeep than it is to Nikita - which could also be one of the reasons it worked with larger crowds. Nonetheless, it is miles ahead of Ranganathan's previous venture Comali. Yogi Babu also gets a meaningful role after a while, and he aces it. Others like Sathyaraj and Raadhika pitch in when necessary. Yuvan's music effectively drives the humorous and earnest moments.",6/10,Love Today
vibhus-17780,6 November 2022,Engaging Rom Com,"A well written hilarious RomCom with hard hitting message for current gen .

Characterisation for each and every character was well designed . Comedy was totally hilarious and relatable , after a long time enjoyed a complete laugh riot . Comparing to Comali , the way Pradeep tried to convey the message in Love today was good and hard hitting . Technical wise editing and music were back bone to the movie . Way they handled the editing gave a unique tone to the movie and helps to grab complete attention from audience . Undoubtedly Yuvan is the 2nd hero of the movie . Overall a complete entertaining RomCom especially targeted for youngsters . Must watch üíØ .

Remarkable screenplay and duration.At first I thought why would this guy wanna act all of a sudden, but after watching this film I realised that no one else could do this role since Kollywood doesn't have young heroes to represent this kinda roles.

The male lead tries to imitate Dhanush but doesn't have his charm. Ivana is beautiful but can't pull off emotional scenes. Yogi Babu is a good actor and his part was good most of the times but rhe ending felt too preachy.Movie's cringe meter goes up every now and then and peaks during the climax.

kumaresanvishnu,3 December 2022,Pretty average honestly,"The only good things in the film is the comedy in first 3/4 , Yogi Babu's character,Raveena Ravi's character and Raadhika Sarathkumar's character. Everything else was bad. If they kept to comedy throughout the entire film I would have given this film a 7/10. The messaging was not mostly appropriate. The lead female character was in my opinion the worst(she makes terrible decisions and is easily swayed) and what's with antagonist? I have never seen an antagonist so poorly written. It felt like they just wanted a situation to come up for the last quarter of the film so they wrote in the antagonist at the last minute. There were plot holes. And honestly the reason for which both characters still love each other is cliche just live 95% of other romance storylines in Indian films(where the girl looks beautiful so the guy falls in love with her). At some point in the movie things could have ended but if that happened the movie would have ended too soon so they compromised on realism just to extend the movie showing how poorly written the story is overall. Honestly just remove the antagonist character and keep the film comedy throughout and that would have saved this movie(not completely) but definitely by a large margin.",5/10,Love Today
tzqdkbnj,3 December 2022,a movie which is dumb and still enjoyable,"The script got some dumb things going around with comedy injected towards serious topics, many dialogues against sl ut shaming and body shaming while the same movie got some scenes glorifying the same.this movie contains really sex ist scenes where actions from the male protagonist is shown to be okay and the same thing from the female character is criticised. Well you can just go and enjoy the film but i felt really triggered and the whole thing was cringy for me. Well my friends too really enjoyed The film. The whole thing didn't worked for me except the acting from Yogi Babu which kinda drove me emotionally.

I'm not going to over examine and look for loop holes. It is a pacca entertainer. Yogi babu as usual scores...but also makes an impact to the screenplay. Radhika stole the show as always. Heroine who can actually lip sync proper for her dilagoues now that is very rare . Highly recommended . Don't wait.

I was expecting more on earlier short to feature film, but disappointed in ""Kaathalil sothappuvathu eppadi"" , but this one handled very well and added lot more extensions to the short film. The best extension is Yogi Babu portion.The problem with this movie is this cant be watched with parents, because of cuss words and the point blank secret revealing of youths.....I cant think of anymore finetuning for this movie.... best one.",10/10,Love Today

chand-suhas,3 December 2022,A thorough entertainer!,"I didn't enjoy Pradeep's Comali much and Love Today is a massive upgrade compared to that. Based on his own short film App(a) Lock, it has a simple story about the differences that arise when a couple exchange their phones for one day. To sell this concept you need veterans Sathyaraj and Raadhika Sarathkumar to probably establish the story. They are effortlessly hilarious and bring in the much needed seriousness. Yogi Babu is another valuable addition and his scene simply stand out towards the end.The comedy scenes range from hilarious to meh but these moments work largely within the context. But it is not entirely silly laughs as Pradeep is clever enough to get the story sensible + emotional at the right time, making an heartfelt commentary about trust. There were hardly any dull moments and my major issue was with a sub plot involving a pervert which felt contrived. Without this also, the conclusion would have had the same impact. The whole boy planting the mango seed expecting it to sprout was a nice touch.Definitely recommended.",7/10,Love Today
its_me_rajit,17 December 2022,A movie with a good intent,"Love today touches upon the delicate subjects digital footprints, privacy,trust issues and social media manipulation while showing the unique story "" the girl and boy agree to swap their phones to check the loyalty before marrying."" They thought they know their partners well but that's not the case . The life goes haywire once they do that.It's not a perfect movie though . It has glitches and the story handling is not delicate. However despite of the glitches the heart of the makers are in right place as they show you the patriarchal dominance in digital world. How casually the harassment is taken even the so called good and innocent boys with golden hearts casually do that, and in the world moving so fast leaving the digital footprints the body shaming is so casual and a meme material that it's very difficult for some people to survive.A movie with a good intent .

ritesh657,4 December 2022,"Innovative, Quirky, Relatable","Innovative, Quirky, RelatableLove Today is an extremely relevant, wild and wacky entertainer which not only is spell-binding in terms of its narrative & writing but also the way it handles emotions as realistically it can with a lot of relatability. Packed with crisp editing, excellent chemistry between the leads, solid humor and a tear jerking finale makes this one of my favourite Indian films of the year. Pradeep Ranganathan exceptional.Exchanging cell phones between a couple just to get parents approval for marriage is itself a crazy experimental film. And this simple plot is smartly packed with loads of relatable moments which keep you hooked to this film. Brilliant editing of the film, where you experience thr in and out of using social media nowdays and the style of writing make this an extremely enjoyable ride. Humor is not forced and mostly situational and based out of conversations.Pradeep Ranganathan deserves a standing ovation for treating this film with love. He is the story writer, screenplay writer, actor and director and he excels in everything. Outstanding facial expressions and situational acting by this guy. Ivana is extremely beautiful and equally a great actor. Her acting potential is promising and she was damn good. Sathyadev and Radhika both brilliant.Instagram : @stream.genx.",9/10,Love Today
ngandacinema,21 November 2022,We were yawning at first but then our jaws dropped!,"Looking at Love Today's trailer, we were yawning, we didn't even feel like seeing the movie because we knew it was going to be dull. With no great Kollywood releases lately, we just summoned the courage to watch this movie knowing fully well we would be bored...Let's just say that Pradeep Ranganathan & team OUTDID themselves! Totally amazed at the immense quality delivered in this production, our jaws dropped! Respect-Where to even start? Everything was so meticulously executed üòÉ The editing was top-notch, very entertaining and active; the graphics and animation inserted enhanced the narrative and increased our engagement-At first glance, we thought Love Today was going to be a childish tale about a boy and girl picking fights over what they saw on each other's phone, 'cos the movie started out this way. As the story progressed, it delved into profound meanings of themes like privacy, trust, inner peace, genuine love, self-respect, honor, resilience, bullying, etc. That was when we began to really pay attention
We thought we knew where Love Today was headed but Pradeep Ranganathan had a bigger horizon in store for us-Nikhita's father (Sathyaraj) takes the best actor award. He blew us away with his different facial expressions: he was creepy, stern, hilarious, disciplinary, and also calm. Hard to know whether he was a friend or foe üòÖ-The cinematography and lighting were just mmm good! So refined and carefully executed. The yellow color grading nicely emphasized the jealous vibe hovering over Pradeep and Nikhita as well as Pradeep's sister and her fianc√©-That mango tree analogy was the show-stopper! It sealed the purpose of the movie and we were applauding Pradeep for coming up with such a brilliant idea to illustrate his point. To avoid spoilers, we're going to stop here ü§ê",10/10,Love Today
gangeshgnair,22 November 2022,It's nice. Give it a watch,"The movie was good. Although the things in the movie may feel random and stylised to cater to the young audience, the movie has a really good screenplay structure. In its own way it had stakes involved. The stakes got higher at each point. Had a good character arc for the main lead. Makes us completely involved in the story. I really liked the way they concluded yogi babus character, it made my eyes wet for a few seconds. I never thought I would ever cry watching a fun filled movie like this. Pradeep ranganathan was good, ivana, raveena ravi, yogi babu, satyaraj all were good. Yuvans songs were nice. Pradeep really is successful as a writer. Many scenes were staged nicely. We get a lot of laughs in many places.One issue I had in the movie is that a few normal scenes were just tried to be elevated with loud music, and pradeeps reaction to some stuff he discovers about ivana in the first half felt a little too much.Solid one time watch movie.",7/10,Love Today

rajvignesh-60140,4 December 2022,A good entertainer,"After a long time i have witnessed a best rom com genre movie in tamil with commercial elements. One of the best rom com i have witnessed in the recent past. Pradeep oh boy he is such a talented young director, with the masterful screenplay, story dailogues delivery and cinematography. The camera angle and the screenplay is really different. The story too. An amazing performance by pradeep too. The best. Just got nostalgic with what i had experienced in the past, this story exactly matches my friends one. All the other characters did played good. I felt the last part a bit dragged but it was worth it. A good message at the end. A fun entertainer. Overall a good movie. Pls do check it out available in netflix. Specail kudos to raveena.

jaybhakta-80095,22 November 2022,watched with subtitles!,I was doubting the reviews for few days but its obvious it have a humor throughout with a great message at end. Great creation by the lead Actor/Director. Very well acted by all actors and scripted for audience to keep hanging onto their seats for next downhill ride as it takes turns rapidly. Some great memories were brought up by the jokes and timing of it. Very well portrait of two lovers holding onto trust at beginning to start a great journey together. If trust is not met it makes the whole process pointless. It could not have been shown in any better light. Thank you for such movie. God bless.,10/10,Love Today
aswathiwarrier-21632,22 November 2022,Good fun,"Loved the movie. One time watch. Good concept of girls dad making a mobile exchange before deciding. And how the flirting behind a serious relation can jeopardize it. The ending was funny. Loved the side story of the sister and her fianc√©e, that part was actually very good. The reason he was not giving his mobile to her was a true surprise but so true. The mothers advice and input towards the end on the kind of boys girls keep as friends and never become anything else is also so true. The hearts of cyber world is so shown in a easy manner. And how hacking can happen. Overall well thought out fun entertainer!

Mangalassery_Neelakandan,9 December 2022,Entertaining Relatable Romantic Comedy-Drama,"One of the most relatable romantic stories in a while. The film itself is fun filled, even including real life incident and scenarios. Pradeep has done and excellent job in everything he has done in this movie. But the most interesting part about the film is that it is totally relatable, the romance scenes the things happening in between the couple, the problems that arise in a relationship everything was perfect. The jokes in between were also good, and the film was really able to showcase a typical love story in the current day and age. There was a subplot of a mango seed in between the movie popping up every now and then but at the end it brings a whole new meaning to the movie. Altogether an entertaining relatable romantic comedy-drama.

May be but I guess social is dominated by A and politics. I guess, the treatment is justified.Does the hero mimic Dhanush? Is it just me feeling or others too? Who is that girl, next door girl and beautiful. I am sure she is from Kerala, yet to research and confirm üòÇNot sure if they got U or A certificate. Hope it's A.

imrannawaz-41582,18 November 2022,Movie is Okay! Nothing more.,"Was really looking forward to watching this after seeing the trailer in Chennai and after I came back decided to watch in California.I see a Lot of the reviews give over 9+, not sure why! Looks like Most of the reviews were influenced lol.. was really looking forward to this being different, with the lead being new and the trailer bring out a lot of humor.Storyline, acting, humor and message aren't really there. Movie is honestly subpar And way better ones out there. Pretty lengthy and draggy for no reason. Lead actor's acting for a first time wasn't too bad but would've been better if he the movie lived up to it's trailer. Either ways, can watch it once. Definitely not more than a 5.

mandard-61085,19 December 2022,A reality check for all couples,"Faith, trust its not just a word but a feeling which is getting expired in recent times. We often get angry, sad because of lack of faith in our loved ones.Love Today is one such movie which emphases this in a very unique way. 2 lovers are told to swap their phones for a day by the girls father to check their trust amongst each other. In that day, those 2 discover some hidden details about each other and how the story unfolds forms the crux of the movie.#pradeepranganathan who is actor, director, writer and producer of the movie has totally given justice to it. Handling a sensitive issue in his 2nd film and doing it well. #Sathyaraj #YogiBabu are perfectly etched in their roles.A beautiful message along with good music and storyline makes this movie a must watch..!!",10/10,Love Today
jonny78,27 November 2022,Funny.,"Love Today is a hilarious film. Really, I haven't seen a film that has made me laugh so hard. The ""mamakutty"" sequence was executed to perfection, and the main character's performance throughout was outstanding. Towards the end of the film though it does get too preachy for its own good, and returns to the usual overdone melodrama of the average Indian film. The deepfake plot line was unnecessary in my opinion, and just extended the runtime to an acceptable one by Indian film standards. The tree served to be a metaphor for trust, but was far too obvious to actually act as a metaphor.The idea itself is very interesting. This film had the potential to be at an 8 or 9 standard if it weren't for that cringe 3rd act, a jarring tone shift from the rest of the film. However, Yogi Babu's plot line was wrapped up very nicely, with a satisfying conclusion.Shouldn't be rated more than a 7.5/10 - it is quite overrated but nonetheless well made, with good editing.",7/10,Love Today

bakthachalam,10 November 2022,Yes! It's a good movie but not for family audiences,"Nice to watch.but not too much super.Popularity of family films among the Indian youth from bollywood has been declining because of the upcoming genres in the Indian cinema such as movies based on comedy, thriller, horror, youth oriented, society art based and many more.Since the new generation prefers movies based on new concepts such as movies based on action , animation society and culture that leads to the stepping out of the family films from the on - going film industry scenario . So therefore family films are produced in a lesser number in comparison to other genre filmsYehhh watch to your friends.

rsip-24247,4 November 2022,Not the best but one of its own kind,"Ove today (2022)
Director: Pradeep Ranganathan
This movie starts off at slow pace but takes a huge turn as it goes forward the movie starts with a happy couple who want to get married but the condition laid by the father of the girl (Satyaraj) is a demand to exchange phones of the couple for a day and if they don't have have any objection the next day the father is more than happy to marry his daughter to pradeep this is the plot of the movie which sounds quite simple has it seems on the screen but what makes it so good and entertaining is the hilarious way pradeep has driven the plot which attracts most of the youngsters out there this is a movie based on every person who is a teenager and till they get married and start a life the movie talks about a serious subject in a hilarious way towards the end which makes it more enjoyable it is not like never seen before but this movie is one of its own kind not the best but a good entertainer.Things which didn't work for me is a scene where the father (Satyaraj) holds pradeep's feet and puts it down it was made with a motive to make it hilarious but i didn't actually find the purpose of that and the conversation between the couples at the beginning of the movie was quite very uncomfortable and more of the screenplay is a bit predictable but you go with the flow the movie and start enjoying itHence this is pradeep's 2nd work after Comali and he has not disappointed his set of audienceA feel good one time watch but totally different from Comali..",7/10,Love Today
hasithcse,26 December 2022,A Trust Worthy Entertainer,"A complete entertainment package dealt with out and out hilarious moments and with fascinating narration. From the trailer we might well capture the essence of the film from the concept they have been shown in the trailer. But what I felt most attractive is the way director dealt with it. Performances of the lead couple is outstanding,infact Pradeep rangathan stole the show with his daffy presence and performance. Overall the film relies on trust and faith on your partner ( Don't worry this is not a spoiler). On a whole love today is an absolute delight to watch specially this film connects so well with the modern youth. Go for it 9/10.

You can able to enjoy, smile, laugh, cry and you can completely experience the entire versatility of emotions you contain. You can able to relate yourself in so many places of the film for sure. Though the casting of completely new apart from some actors all of them delivered a beautiful job in their screen presence. The director has not only done a great job in his direction but also he proved his potential as an actor writer screenplay and as a lyricist he completely nailed it as an all rounder in this film. The music was so perfect that it suited ever sequence. Overall the best film in recent times.

jazrathinam,26 November 2022,Addictive movie,"Its definitely not a disappointment. Pradheep has given a great insight on how social media is used in bad ways & how relationships are among the young generation. Though most of the casts are new, they did a great job. Being known as a versatile actor & actress, Satyaraj & Radhika were really entertaining & suited the role. Yogi babu may look serious in certain scenes but they were funny. Songs & BGM were awesome. Hats off to Yuvan. This movie doesn't seem to be Pradheep's 2nd movie apart from his short films. It was really well-executed. Hope he continues to bring in more movies like this & Comali.

Director narrated the story in an engaging way and it entertained me. In my point of view, this movie isn't a theatrical standard but definitely a OTT standard.

vivekupadhyay-62630,19 January 2023,Desperate attempt to look and act like Dhanush!,"Only saving grace of the film were the supporting cast, be it actors mom and friends or actresses father. I actually thought there might be a reason about that boy shown peeing in the agni kund fire while the ceremony was going on I still did not understand what was the need to show the little boy doing that in the agni kund during the wedding ceremony (uncalled for) as it was just there without any use of it. The movie is Mostly predictable and keeps getting stretched for no important reason. Also annoying part is the actor who time and again after every frame acts like Dhanush and is in literally every other scene of the movie.

Biswas_,3 June 2022,A heavily commercialized version !,"In order to make the film presentable to the masses, the makers have opted for a very commercialized version of Major Sandeep's biopic. The creative liberties come into picture during the main part of the film, that is, the 26/11 part and it is understandable because as i said, masses will enjoy it.The first 30-40 mins i would recommend you skip. It was boring and the school sequences between Sandeep and his gf was kinda boring to watch. In fact, the love angle is the most bollywoodish thing in this film , a typical cliche love story. Hence it did not click for me.Now coming to the main part, the last 1 hr 20 mins of this film is a treat for commercialized action lovers. They have maintained a balance between realistic and rather commercialized unrealistic sequences. This last 1 hr or so held on to my attention right till the last second of this film. It was that interesting and gripping!The last part made me really emotional. His parents , unsure about what Sandeep's condition is, suddenly finding their son on tv being shown martyred was really painful and emotional for me to watch. Don't miss these parts.Other than that, there are certain fictionalized sequences that are far from realistic like some of Sandeep's acrobatics (mind you , as i said, it is done to make the film presentable to masses) or the terrorists being shown arriving at daytime while actually they arrived in the evening in dark time. Of course, by now we have seen so many 26/11 based films and sequences and all present that day in their own way.The media angle is presented in a sarcastic way here with little fiction. We all know how terrorists were using the idiotic media to track commandos but here Watch out for a fictional sequence where Sandeep would turn the tables and use the media to wreck the terrorists instead. That was like an ""ooooooooo"" moment. In fact there is one hilarious sarcastic sequence where a media guy covering Nariman Point would see the commandos getting killed and says on live news ""I can't understand how the terrorists are able to figure out that commandos are coming "" as he keeps covering them live. It was sarcastic.Songs , not one to remember. Performance by Adivi Shesh is terrific. He looks just young enough to represent Major Sandeep. He excels in the last 1 hr. Saiee Manj is average as she carries her one expression throughout the film. Prakash Raj too does a good job .Overall, must watch! Full on entertainment guaranteed . If you miss the first 30 mins also due to some delay to reach theatre, then nothing to worry you haven't missed anything .",8/10,Major

limbanivinay-739-258698,18 July 2022,Major Lack of Reality,"It's a total waste of time and as i said Major lack of reality, i can't get why the makers fantasize a true story into a love story cum herogiri it should just happen the way it did they shouldn't overdo it. I had very high hopes from Major but it disappoints in every segment.

harish-55305,4 June 2022,"""Based"" on true story Lots of factual inaccuracies","This movie is based on a real soldier. They should have shown some reality.The action director has made a mockery of NSG. Commando jumping around like a superhero, firing more bullets from a pistol without reloading than any real pistol could hold in a single magazine. This along with a lot of emotional drama to tocuh the sentiments of the audience.They should have made a fictional movie instead of blatantly using real names and having factual inaccuracies at the same time. Turned a soldier's heroic story into a dramatic piece of garbage. Only thing missing was an item song. Shame on such scriptwriters.

nitsvirusboyz,4 June 2022,Recommended üëçüèº by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"Major is a perfect tribute to Sandeep Unnikrishnan and his story is worth watching & deserves to be told. The movie delivers what it promises, the first half is decent and the second half is gripping with its outstanding climax that will leave you teary-eyed.Adivi Sesh has delivered his career-best performance. He perfectly portrays the patriotism and emotional side of the army officer's life. Prakash Raj and Revathi were impressive. Revathi brings a lot of emotional depth to the film and Prakash Raj's climax speech was impactful & leaves everyone with moist eyes. Murali Sharma is effective and dependable as always. Sobhita Dhulipala was good in her limited role and Saiee M Manjrekar's performance was just fine. Anish Kuruvilla and other supporting actors including the actors who played the terrorist role have delivered convincing performances.Sashi Kiran Tikka's direction is excellent. The film starts on a low note which is more focused on the romantic side of Major but it ends on a very emotional note with some engrossing action sequences. The music is average, the background music is good, and the cinematography is splendid. There are several wow moments for the viewers during the operation scenes. Do wait for the end credits to watch out for the snapshots of Sandeep's life.",8/10,Major
isshamanchanda,3 June 2022,Worth watching,"Thanks to GMB Entertainment for bringing this Film to the audience.Just came out of the theatre with a heavy heart and cud not stop my self to write. As if someone in my family died saving people in the taj hotel saving hostages. We'll get connected to Major Unnikrishnan very well. Good job by Director Mr. Kiranraj.Kudos.

surajgorti,4 June 2022,"Major - You may take me , but not my Country","Major is a 2022 biopic of one of the heroes of '26/11' attacks, ""Sandeep Unnikrishnan"" . Diving in
his life, all you'll find is patriotism. Which we all knew, but what about his love life ? To present his personal life is the main motto of the movie as well as the makers. So 'Major' is not about how he died, it's about how he lived his life. Talking about the performances, I felt casting crew which includes , Adivi Sesh , Saiee Manjarekar, Prakash Raj , Revathi , Murali Sharma they were very well selected as they did not just perform it they lived in it. Sesh just nailed the role, When released the first look of the Major, everyone felt Adivi Sesh is the lookalike of the Major. This factor made the movie more relatable. Saiee's acting seemed mature enough as compared to her previous works. No need to tell about the other leads (Prakash Raj, Revathi etc). Their style of acting/versatility is impeccable.Story and execution
Sandeep Unnikrishnan a guy who took birth in Kerala,was enthusiastic and dedicated to his deeds. He always wanted to serve the Nation ,hence joins the Indian Army after Completing the training later he becomes the NSG Commandos trainer. When got the news about the 26/11 attacks he gets himself and his troops ready to save the hostages and to finish the darkness spread over the city. How he saves the hostages and plans made by him to kill the terrorists is to be watched.When , making a biopic the makers focus more on attracting the audience, which often misleads in showing up the reality . But in this case, Sesh just showed his skills as he didn't just meet the family of Sandeep he adopted the nature of him. And this needs appreciation.The execution was quite decent.Story and screenplay by Sesh was very
engaging.Direction by Sashi Kiran Tikka was too good.Music by Sricharan Pakala was rocking.The bgms and sound effects were
awesome.Editing by the duo Vinay and Pawan didn't
let audience feel flat.Production values were of top class
Few shots esp, in the
second half gives you thrilling vibes.Few scenes were abrupt and over the
top emotions. But when watching with the
same emotion it doesn't matter to the
audience.Hence, the team is successful in
bringing people to watch Major by free
screening, promotions etc.Verdict
'Major' shouldn't be missed and is a perfect tribute to the legend 'Sandeep'. 'Don't come up I'll handle them' this one line is enough to describe his life and to get your tickets booked.",8/10,Major
valyriansteel-68349,7 July 2022,Over dramatization and substandard narration!!,"With due respect to the great real life warrior Sandeep Unnikrishnan. I wonder why this movie has high rating here. Biopics don't need to be action packed and hero centric. We just need facts not exaggerated drama. The makers are cashing in on patriotism. Hotel Mumbai was so captivating in terms of narration. This movie is all about hero and his stunts. What a slog!

jeewan-1,5 July 2022,Nationalism is a fire that will burn the country!!,"The one who is proud of this movie and rated this 10 stars, probably does not pay his taxes, throws rubbish on the streets, votes based on religion. There is nothing wrong with this movie but it's certainly not a 8.6.Its loaded with dramatisation, fake heroism and absurd amounts of superhuman abilities.If a child is studying under a street lamp because he or she has not light or electricity at home, it is hailed as the child's determination to study, what you fail to understand is that its your failure as a taxpayer not to ask the questions you were supposed to ask of the person you elected.The 26/11 attacks could have been prevented if instead of being reactive, the officials were proactive and heeded to several warnings. It is our collective failure that it took NSG 9 hours to reach the location. In the movie, this is not addressed, rather it is shown as if they reached immediately. It is our failure that young soldiers, police, many innocent lives were lost that day.How do you make up for your incompetence? By rating this movie 10 stars and hiding under the guise of patriotism which you definitely have no idea what that is. While you are naive and dumb, there will be more producers, studios and actors who will milk this genre until their banks are full.",4/10,Major
abhishek-kumar5,10 July 2022,This could have been much much better,"I am an ex nda myself and seeing this movie felt as if justice was not done to the kind of life Major unni led and died for. The amateur training scenes , the weak characters , the romance and even the cute looks doesn't do justice to the great man..major unni used to keep his hair style crew cut since he was in school . That basic detail is even missing. This after all is a cheesy commercial movie. I am tired of film industry ruining the story of our brave martyrs.

deepuwithpapu,5 June 2022,Ending portrayed well,"While the 1st half is lagging a little on acting on emotion, 2nd half covers everything. There are opportunities in expression where the background actors had no expression in few scene while anyone in that situation would be alert. Apart from acting direction is very well done. As usual Adavi Shesh would never disappoint fans with his role and acting. Worth the watch. Rating 7 coz of lacking in acting in few instances and could've done a lot better.

k-kalyan,7 July 2022,Bland and dramatic,"I feel this movie has lowered the status of Indian Army. Shows that army men are emotional, non-rational, defy orders, do not obey their rules or seniors and change rules as they fancy...
A nice story dramatised to insult the real events...

parasadvani-30709,13 July 2022,Most of the reviews are based on patrotic feelings,"I finished the whole movie in half an hour because it was predictable.. even dialogues... over-heroic and oversmartness all over the place.. not even close to reality. I can understand the feelings of a patriot but at least don't mix emotions with movie ratings... movies are business and ur fooling other users to forcefully watch the movie based on these ratings and reviews.

dhirajouer,9 July 2022,Too much Bollywood Drama,"You can surely skip the first 40 minutes which was ultra boring and also skip many drama scenes. The stunts they show which the Major has done is insane. The film does not pay an absolute tribute to Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, but worth watching once.

samirancme,6 November 2022,Drama and All about the actor not the Character,"There are numerous movies and series released on 26/11 attack and as a viewer I am familiar the sequence of event. Expectation was a sneak peak in Major UNNIKRISHNAN's life and operations from his point of view.The portrayal of a NSG at the rank of major with such callous and casual conduct is highly disappointing.Instead of NSG Commando, act looks like of a common rescuer. Each other commando is wearing helmet while the lead role player doesn't had to. He roaming around showing emotional weakness and excessively caring behavior instead of showing speed, authority, and tactfulness. Highly disappointed to see the movie couldn't even recreate the tension and seriousness of the situation which is an absolute basic of the plot.

There are some deep messages in the movie and it is moving, however, because it seems to be made for an audience which is used to a gaudy spectacle, it is hard to take the movie serious at times, which is a shame.As a foreigner/international movie watcher, Hotel Mumbai is a much better movie about the Mumbai terror attacks and in a completely different league, so if you've already watched that one, you will be disappointed with ""Major"" and may even find it's glorification tasteless.",4/10,Major

The action scenes have so many cuts in between. Some action scenes are beyond understanding because of so many cuts. If you really want to watch an army movie then watch Shershah,Uri ,Lakshya,Top Gun Maverick,Dunkirk. If you still don't believe this review then go and watch it,you would realise what I am talking about.

When Major Sandeep was taking his last breath, he heard his mother's voice and when his mother gets the news of his death, she heard Sandeep's voice.After that he sees his father
In movie this thing is shown with such emotion that when a person's last moment comes, he hears the voices of his loved ones and their faces come in front of him.# Major Sandeep's behavior of selfless service to the needy people In the movie you will understand that when it comes to saving someone, Sandeep does not stop even if you try.Senior officer says terriost have only one principle kill and die. How many of our soldiers should I be willing to loose to save them at this time? Major Sandeep says only one and that was the reason when he asked Major Sandeep Do you need any backup? His last words were ""Don't come up I will handle them""What does it mean to be a soldier? Two beautiful dialogues from this movie that reveal exactly what it really means to be a soldier,
First- This question cannot be answered, it can only be lived.Second- Not only to fight with courage but also to be courageous of all
And Major sandeep unnikrishnan showed both the things to be true, he fought with courage and became the courage of everyone.# ""Main hoon na"" ""I am with you"". He used to say this to every person who was scared or lost his courage.# In this movie, what is the media, this thing is clearly shown in a small scene that how media only wants breaking news and for them live TRP is more important than life.# In movie Sandeep steals his mother's purse so that he can go and give some money to one prisoner, but that purse stays with him and whenever he remembers his mother, he kisses that purse. That's why many times in the film Sandeep is shown kissing a red purse.# His father's speech is very emotional Prakash Raj did an excellent job# A terrorist in a red T-shirt hit Major Sandeep from behind twice. It has been shown in the film that these cowards can only attack from behind, they do not have the courage to do it from the front.# If you really understand what the film is trying to convey to you, it is the way he lived, not just the way he was martyred. He was always ready to help others, he used to be the courage of others, and when it comes to the country, he used to move forward alone without any fear. Becoming an inspiration of selflessness putting himself first and a courage to do anything for country.Adivi Sesh nailed it. I never heard of this actor before but after seeing Major I can definitely say his acting in this flim is top notch his years of efforts to make a flim on the life of Sandeep unnikrishnan has come true and on second is Prakash Raj, the emotions he putted in this flim is excellentVicky Kaushal got National award for Uri: The Surgical Strike
Siddharth Malhotra got 3 awards for Shershaah including Dada Saheb Phalke AwardDespite these two films being one of the best films of Indian cinema, I did not cry after seeing either of them. But after seeing Major I really cried and was able to feel what a soldier is. Now we the audience have to decide which award Adivi Sesh and Prakash Raj, director, music composer, sound designer and whole team of Major deserves? Which is really people's love and support, so please watch this movie in theatres.",10/10,Major
nnk-39990,10 June 2022,Loved it !,"Enjoyed every bit of it ... excellent direction .. super real I would say. Beautifully acted by every single character. Hats off to the entire team. Actor is the back bone of the movie he rides it on his shoulders.

Who told this man to go in a mission where he is not basically allowed to go! Lame! That mission wasn't for him, he went there forcefully !! And died certainly !! So !! He is hero?

surajkailase,6 July 2022,A good Biopic üëç,"I thought this could be a usual Bollywood patriotic movie and it feels the same in beginning but it paces up and gives us a good glimpse of the life and sacrifices of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan.Story : The story begins from his childhood scenes which shows us that his father is from Navy and so he to wants to be the same and it also portrays his courage. Then we get to know his college and love life which feels like a regular Bollywood romantic movie but the story gets interesting when he gets into the NSG where he works hard and trains himself to be one of the best and this is what makes him a Major. Then the story focuses on the Taj attacks and let's us know what a great contribution and sacrifice is given to this country by Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan.Performances : I found the performance of the lead actor Adivi Shesh weak in the beginning (as a collage boy) don't know exactly why but from the time he gets into NSG it felt ok and while coming to the end, great. All the supporting cast has given nice performences especially Prakash Raj.My verdict : Major is a great biopic and a good way to telling us the story of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, his personal life, sacrifices of his family and himself.. The pace of the movie is good, it doesn't feels slow. The action is good. There are little special effects which don't feel bad and we get a good patriotic movie in the end.",7/10,Major
ahmadqdn,15 July 2022,Worst Army movie,"This movie didn't look like it's based on real life story. More like based on director's dumb fairytales.Major sandeep is a real hero of this nation and the way he's potrait in this movie is not just his insult but it's the insult of our specialised Armed force and this nation itself.The movie is full of mistakes and flaws. This isn't the way of NSG or any armed force.The director should stop making anymore films on army personnel and start watching Doraemon.

creativepriyanka,8 June 2022,Making money from a death of soldier,Not a good movie as it has to include people who really look like soldiers not like model.A soldier can never be represented by any creatures of bollywood/tollywood/sandalwood etc etc as Indian soldier's image is something special and these gutter people can never represent them.,1/10,Major
beevenkat,5 June 2022,who is a soldier?,"There could be three probable answers to the question: who is a soldier? (1) one who adores the uniform? (2) one who fights evil? (3) one who shields himself and others? Adivi Sesh tries to find the correct answer by playing #SandeepUnnikrishnan in #Major. Right from his childhood, he proves that he is capable of sheltering anyone who is assaulted. But this film isn't only about the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. It is more about a man who is a good son, a faithful companion and a plucky combatant. Performances are excellent. Running time needs to be reduced by 15 minutes. Rating 3/5.

dsai-41029,9 July 2022,I don't understand why so many 10 point reviews here?,"When you try to show a real story in the form of a cinema.. try to be original. I see so many people calling ""Vande Mataram"" in the reviews.. but do they even know how many shortcomings were there in the actual scenario?1. What was the intelligence doing, did anyone question our intelligence department?2. The so called terrorists did not bring tanks and missiles, they were hardly carrying guns. So NO - we did not actually needed army or NSG to be brought there. Mumbai police should have taken care of it.3. And why was NSG so late to reach there? What they did there was amazing but if ONLY they would have reached there on time they could have saved hundreds of more lives. Heck - even media guys reached before them.Now coming to the movie - no doubt the major was a martyr and a ""hero"" in real life. But when presenting a movie like this, try to be real - NSG is a team. It should not be a Tollywood/Bollywood masala where a single person is fighting with all the terrorists alone. Give credit to other soldiers too - they don't have to be martyred to earn that respect!!At least learn something from movies like ""zero dark thirty"" etc.",2/10,Major
vineshtatineni,4 July 2022,First half of the movie was very bad,"The 2nd half if the movie is awesome but I felt the first half of the movie to be pretty boring.Good of one time watch and its much better than ram gopal varma's version of 26/11 movie.

shoaibulab-929-158980,12 July 2022,Too much Melodramatic,"Started watching with lots of hope. Disappointed other other melodramatic hindi move. It don't resemble the real life army man at all! Each and every scene is melodramatic. Shame on director & cast of this movie.

ffazsdp,4 June 2022,Very much heart touching and emotional,"For me personally, I like biopic's and if the movie is about our soldiers then I be very much emotional. I've literally struggled to maintain my calm in the theatre, trying not to burst out. Tears rolled from my eyes., could feel the pain what major Sandeep Unnikrishnan's relation have felt. Take a break, go and spend your money on this movie, its totally worth watching in theatres. I felt shivers., and I assure, every Indian will have the same feeling as mine. So please, don't wait for the OTT release., as this isn't the film to be watched in small screen.

arungeorge13,3 July 2022,A mixture of crisp action and delightful storytelling! [+70%],"If Hotel Mumbai took us through the Taj Hotel terrorist attack from the perspective of the survivors, Major focuses purely on the journey of Sandeep Unnikrishnan and his heroics in said tragic incident. The film scores majorly in its action blocks, with the visual crispness and performances both contributing immensely. The family and romance portions work to an extent, because the former is spearheaded by the very homely duo of Prakash Raj and Revathi while the latter features a relatively new face in Saiee Manjrekar. Adivi Sesh is undoubtedly on a roll, where his presence is a subtle indicator of quality cinema. He embodies every bit of a soldier in almost flawless fashion, while also remaining fairly adorable in the dramatic scenes.Also, one thing I loved about Major is that it doesn't conveniently stuff patriotism into scenes just to further intensify them. Of course, the cinematic liberties are aplenty, but Major manages to get your adrenaline pumping in the set-pieces and leave you teary-eyed in the climactic stretch.",7/10,Major
IPyaarCinema,1 August 2022,Emotional Roller Coaster Ride,"Major is a patriotic action drama that lives up to the hype. Beautiful performances, endearing drama, and solid thrills are basic assets of the film. In the past, there are a number of films that have been made on the Mumbai 26/11 attacks but where Major scores brownie points are the emotions. The story and screenplay are by Adivi Sesh and he gets the emotion behind the soldier's life right and sets the film in a perfect manner.",7/10,Major
cs_rahul_kumar,3 July 2022,A Heart-Touching Tribute to Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan by Adivi Sesh !!!,"""What is a soldier ?"" is a question Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan has had to grapple with since he joined the Indian Army. It's a question he asks himself even as he fights terrorists in Mumbai on the fateful day of 26/11.You know how the saying goes, that funerals are for the living and not the dead ? If you thought that Sashi Kiran Tikka's Major was just a tribute to the 26/11 martyr, you're wrong. This film is a tribute to the sacrifices a lonely wife had to make whenever her husband is off fighting bad guys, sacrifices parents have to make while praying their son is not the one called to war. This film is for those whose sacrifices are seldom acknowledged while they're most often the ones left mourning.Sandeep Unnikrishnan (Adivi Sesh) has a protective instinct embedded in his DNA. He feels fear but he doesn't think twice before putting himself in harm's way if it means saving someone's life. It's no wonder that even as a little boy, he finds himself fascinated with the 'uniform' and a soldier's way of life. But what does being a soldier mean? Does it mean forgoing being a good husband and son, does it mean putting oneself first on the battlefield or going to the extremes of being a sacrificial lamb with no self-preservation? Even as he contends with these questions, a tragedy strikes the nation and Sandeep, who's an NSG major now, must do his bit.Going into Major, you already know how the 26/11 terrorism attack in Mumbai will play out; you also know that Sandeep will end up a martyr. So how does one tell a tale where the audience is already familiar with the major beats ? While one could nit-pick and think of various other ways, director Sashi Kiran Tikka and Adivi Sesh, who wrote the story and screenplay, decide to focus on Sandeep the human as a whole rather than just Sandeep the martyr. When the inevitable happens, you mourn not just a soldier who sacrificed his life for the country but a life that he could've lived. To reveal anything more about this coming-of-age tale would be an injustice.Aiding Adivi Sesh, Saiee Manjrekar (who plays his childhood sweetheart Isha) and Shobitha Dhulipala (who plays a businesswoman called Pramoda Reddy) are a strong technical team. Saiee gets a character with heart, one that is fully fleshed out instead of existing for the sake of it. Shobhitha's Pramoda too is as detailed as it can be; given the circumstances she's introduced in. Abburi Ravi's dialogues and Sricharan Pakala's music blatantly play on your emotions but they do it well for the most part. In fact, it's one of their best works. Vamsi Patchipulusu's cinematography goes from dreamy to suffocating, depending on the scene playing out while Vinay Kumar Sirigineedi and Kodati Pavan Kalyan make some smart editing choices that stand out in key scenes. The action sequences by Naba also stand out.The film is not without his flaws though. Abburi Ravi's dialogues and Sricharan's music do get a little too heavy handed in some scenes, forcing you to feel a certain way even before you feel it organically. Sandeep and Isha's meet-cute doesn't have the desired effect even if their story does get stronger as the film progresses. Certain tracks regarding Sandeep's army-mates seem incomplete. There are a few other things one could nit-pick too but the way the film is crafted with a non-linear screenplay, it doesn't really let you think much. But it is to be noted that the film isn't factual, both in the way the events of 26/11 played out and how Sandeep presumably handled it.Adivi Sesh gets the role of his lifetime and he grabs it with both hands. He does a good job of playing both a smooth faced teenager who might come across as na√Øve to a man who knows what he wants from life and is willing to fight for it, even if circumstances don't always allow it. Saiee fits the role as far as her age is concerned but she comes across as raw and inexperienced in the emotional scenes. Shobitha breezes through her role, so do Murli Sharma and Anish Kuruvilla. Prakash Raj and Revathi, who play Sandeep's parents, give the role their all. Everything from the way they love their son to grieve him comes across as heartbreakingly realistic.Major might be an action drama for the most part where guns and bombs become the norm after a certain run-time, but the film does a good job of opting for a personal tone instead of a jingoistic one, when the latter might have been easier. This one deserves to be watched more than once.",10/10,Major
AJ_McAninch,7 July 2022,Superb Action Film with Heart,"As good an action film as any produced and better than a lot: it is both thrilling and heartbreaking. ""Major"" has excellent pacing and direction, a sweet love story, touching performances by a terrific cast. But it is a Adiva Sesh's performance, alternately gentle and nuanced in Sandeep's love for his family and comrades-then as extraordinary and powerful a performance as one could ask for by an action star. He carries the heavy role of the film's center and as Sandeep excels. Most important, the film treats Major Sandeep with respect and introduces this brave, heroic, good man to a world that may not have known about him but will now never forget him.

madanmarwah,15 July 2022,A riveting re-creation of 26/11 events,"Quite a few movies have been made on the subject of 26/11 events and this is also one. A difference however being that it is also a biopic on Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan ( enacted by Adivi Shesh) who achieved martyrdom while fighting with terrorists that night. The earlier part of the movie shows that even as an infant Sandeep was fond of wearing uniform and helping people in distress. After NDA training he is inducted into the elite NSG. He also has a brief romantic relationship with Saiee Manjrekar whom he marries later. The movie has captured the events at the Taj Mahal hotel in great details and full marks to both director Sashi Kiran Tikka and actor Adivi for this achievement. A few minor liberties may have been taken with the ethos and traditions of the Army but these will be noticed only by some. On the whole the impact is positive. The second half of the movie is full of exciting action in the hotel and has been shown realistically. Only those involved in the real events will be able to comment on the correctness of the sequences. To others like this reviewer, it is a riveting experience to sit through. Some sequences are touching specially where the parents ( Prakash Raj and Revathi) are seen. Adivi as the Major has acted superbly and makes it believable. He is credited with writing the story and screenplay and hence his is a case of total involvement which shows in the product. Saiee makes a cute heroine and acts well. The movie has excellent technical qualities specially cinematography and editing which have given the movie a high quality.",8/10,Major

However, 'Major' stand out from all of these in a special way and really surprised me. 'Major' is able to make an emotional connection with the viewers which makes it the best when compared to other similar kind of movies. Emotions are all high and made me tears at the end, a must watch movie.

vibhus-17780,11 July 2022,Good,"More than a Biopic , it was a good action entertainer . This movie is based on the life of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan . First half shows his life journey before Taj attack , his family , training portion was good to watch , especially his character establishment was well portrayed . Second half completely filled with action sequence . Adivi Sesh as actor did a great job . Drawback , it's OK to commercialize a Biopic , but Climax was too cinematic , so at end it felt like a normal action entertainer . Overall a good tribute to Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan .

cinemapichollu,4 July 2022,A Must Watch for Every Indian,"Sashi Kiran Tikka's Major is a touching biopic showing the way Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan lived rather than how he died. It sets up the life story of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan and uses those life events to describe the events of the 26/11 attack which occurred in Mumbai, India.Regarding performances, Adivi Sesh already looked almost similar to Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan as per the photos and promotional events released. But after watching the film, I can truly say no one else could portray the hero so well and he truly captivates the audience. The next ones to leave the same out of impact are Prakash Raj and Revathi's characters as Major Sandeep's parents, we feel almost everything with them whether it's when they learn their son decides to become a soldier or even when he passes during the 26/11 attacks. Saiee Manjrekar does fine in her role, but she isn't offerred much of a meaty role to be remembered much after the film.The action sequences and choreography noticed in the second half of the film are laudable and truly of some of the highest quality scene in Indian cinema, it reminded me of some of the fine action choreography in Hollywood action flicks. Additionally they complimented the writing very well and actually made good use of the set up from the incidents prior to the 26/11 attack involved in the movie in the choreography. The movie largely is about the 26/11 attack and Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan's actions to save those under attack, but the movie used the life story told in the first half of the film well to justify his actions during the attack.The cinematography is also quite good with proper layovers and color mixing done to help tell the chronology of the events playing on the screen and to emphasize the explosions and whatnot seen during the 26/11 attack. There are clear visuals which help maintain a beauty. The VFX was quite good considering the low budget of the film, although in some areas it was a little evident that the fire effects were fake.The major takeaway for me was definitely how Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan lived his life. It was truly an inspiring story and one of the best biopics I have seen (came at a time when I was totally tired and bored off biopics). It is definitely an important movie to watch for Indians to realize the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families when they take the decision to protect us. The writing is quite emotional and touching in many places, but totally leaves you in tears at the end despite you knowing what happens.Overall, Major stands as a film which should be watched to learn how Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan lived. Moreover, the emotional writing and the fantastic action sequences make it an extremely satisfying watch for all.",9/10,Major
abhinav_2405,8 June 2022,A great tribute to Major Sandeep but not necessarily the greatest film,"I wouldn't call it the best film ever made. The first half editing is average. The scenes are beautiful and sets up the character Sandeep is, but the flow between the scenes is missing. It's just dispersed all over. The romantic track is a minus. Most of it is excused considering the Major. But once Sandeep joins NDA, that's where the movie shines. It gives a different high and there are many cheerworthy moments. And the ending is just brilliant. Makes every grown man cry. I felt better music and editing could've made the film even better. But yeah. This is what it is and definitely a great watch.

Quite in line with ""Thattathin marayathe pennu"". To draw a comparison, Pranav has a whole lot more flair to offer than Nivin.Music has been well done, and is a continuous presence. Blending music into the situations has been pretty seamless.Cinematography has been good. The interval shot with Pranav at a train door against red light is a keeper.There is a lot of college nostalgia through out the movie. Some of the moments in the movie feel very genuine.The movie did not end with a bang for me. Nothing substantial really came out. However, there is a lot of heart and youthful enthusiasm through the movie. Darshana and Pranav have performed very well, and Pranav is slowly firming his foot as the romantic star.",8/10,Hridayam
worldexplorerindia,23 January 2022,Movie for youngsters,"All movie running around love, college life, relationship, careers.Best part: shooting location, good thoughts about how parents can stop the alcohol behaviour in adolescents and nicely portrayed charactersIt's resembling the telugu movie "" happy days"" eventhough not exactly same but the comedy is very good.Good for adolescents.

But it's overrated to be honest movie is just an average movie in which i found some of things too clich√©. Acting isnt something which can be deemed as the best. Pranav is considerably better from his earlier works. Its a good one time watch but isn't upto Vineeth's other movies .

geethugeorge,21 February 2022,No Idea what the hype is all about.,"It's such a long movie and you feel like why is it being dragged so much. Too many songs stuffed into it. Songs are pretty good but there was no need for so many.To be honest I did'nt get what the hype was all about. The same college days and meet up after many years. Nothing new and nothing special. It really irritates me when they show the love at first sight scenes and the girls hair is so perfect and its flying in the air. There's nothing real about it.One point to highlight is that Pranav Mohanlal has improved as an actor as I didn't feel irked seeing him act as he was in irupathionnam nootandu.The only good element that I loved about the movie is Johnny Antony.Overall, its a watchable ordinary movie showing college life and the life after that.",6/10,Hridayam

storm_breaker,25 January 2022,Hridayam - straight from the Heart,"Congratulations to Vineeth Sreenivasan and Team for creating this masterpiece. It's hard to get a satisfying movie experience nowadays especially when it comes with high hopes. Hridayam has done that smoothly and delivers even more.Hridayam is a drama following the life of Arun Neelakandan (nice shoutout to the iconic Mohanlal character) from his college days til becoming a family man. His relationship with collegemate Darshana and his friends and how the campus affects his life forms the crux of the first half. His journey as a matured adult is presented in the later half. Pranav has done an amazing job as the protagonist. Many shots reminded me of a young Mohanlal. All the actors - Darshana, Kalyani, Aju and the fresh faces who acted as Arun's classmates deserve praise for their performance.The movie is relatively lengthy. But the writer-director shows his mastery by presenting it without boring the viewers for a single second. The movie can be considered a musical- with songs filled throughout (I think around 15 songs) but all fit well with situation.I highly recommend this movie and I guarantee that Hridayam will give you a wholesome feeling. Many scenes will definitely stay in your heart for days after leaving the theatre - some that will make you smile and some that bring tears.",10/10,Hridayam
arungeorge13,18 February 2022,Nostalgia fest that only partially works! [+53%],"Imagine opening a school-going kid's bag. You'll find an assortment of things in there. Some of it is colorful - like crayons and sketch pens. Some of it is informative - like fat textbooks. Some of it can sting if carelessly used - like a compass. Some of it tastes brilliant - like a lunch-box. The whole package is what we'd all look back at with relatable nostalgia. That's Hridayam summed up! But since it's a Vineeth Sreenivasan film, it comes with the customary plasticity in its treatment. Hesham Abdul Wahab's musical score punctuates almost the entire 3 hours, making the film a lot more bearable. Performance-wise, Darshana Rajendran towers over the rest, while the others are okayish. Kalyani Priyadarshan's on-screen cuteness is put to good effect, while Pranav Mohanlal shows improvement.The supporting characters usually play memorable roles in these generic coming-of-age films. I didn't come across any standout supporting performances, but that's again a problem with the superficial writing. If your cup of tea is diving into perfunctory nostalgia, then Hridayam may work a lot better for you than it did for me. The way Vineeth Sreenivasan romanticizes the whole world around him and ensures that the audience feels it too (not in a subtle way) makes Hridayam an ordinary effort.",5/10,Hridayam
anandhus-99160,23 January 2022,Director Movie,"Hridayam is quite well movie, As mentioned director only let us to feel what he wanted audience to be felt.Plot lies around the life span of 18 to early 30's of a man so pranav character is quite relatable or most of the character is relatable to common mallu boys.Hridayam is not built in a solid story but it's screenplay deserves an applaudes but at few points the same desreved critics too.Editing takes a promienent role in flowfull narration.Considering actors part everyone does their job right , darshana rajendhran way ahead of rest, she is very expressive actor in todays gen.Pranav Mohanlal's acting quality cannot be measured with this movie, as the director claimed he doesnt forced character into pranav later he used pranav as character.Pranav's screen presence , mannerism, charisma in the big screen in irreplacable. But unfortuantely we can't fully analise his acting capacity with this movieMusic and bgm needed to be emphasised, both are the backbone of this movie. Hesham magic is classic. Recommend theatre watch for both bgm and musicOver all Hridayam is well written and conceived movie but it lacks the audience connection to the story, which is always available in vineeth sreenivasan movies but not in this.Its seems like watching arun's life instead of feeling arun's life. Arun is relatable but not felt.If they could have managed that flaw Hridayam would have been a stunning theatre experience.But still its good movie and not so typical feel good stuff.",8/10,Hridayam
SAJINCHANDRAN,22 January 2022,Like a river,"Apart from the end of first half everything else in the movie is good. The soule of the movie is music and the music director done it perfectly. Screenplay deviate slightly towards the end of first half. Pranav darshana and kalyani priyadarshan are perfect like beau id√©al. A must watch souleful movie.

nidhunmoviebuff,23 January 2022,A Vineeth Sreenivasan signature masterpiece!,"Vineeth Sreenivasan is a celebrated musician, screenwriter and actor but I firmly believe that his true craft comes through in his vivid, imaginative and soul-stirring direction, lending heart and joy to even the most clich√© and commonplace narratives. Hridayam is not a new story by any stretch of the imagination but the deft hand of Malayalam's most beloved director in the nostalgic romance genre weaves his magic wand to create a canvas that instantly builds a connection with audiences and reels you in as the story moves along.We are taken through the life of Arun Neelakantan (Pranav Mohanlal), first as the quintessential reluctant millennial engineering student, new to Chennai and experiencing ragging, love and heartbreak all at once. Having done my engineering in the exact same batch (2006-2010) as the characters in the storyline, the nostalgia of it all was hitting me in waves, scene after scene as everything from the bulky mobile phones to the ragging to the struggle to clear semester exams took me back to what was definitely the ""good old days"".Darshana Rajendran is expectedly terrific as Arun's college girlfriend lending her own distinct voice to a nuanced character that would have come off as petulant and even childish if handled by an actress of lesser calibre. She is the centrepiece that holds the narrative together, generating the moments of conflict that takes the initial story forward and finally playing a compelling role in the final act as well. Kalyani Priyadarshan is charming and relatable as ""Nithya"" with the role carrying shades of ""Nikhita"", another character she essayed in the blockbuster Varane Avashyamund (2020).I could write pages and pages about Hesham Abdul Wahab's ethereal music in the film. You would think that he has already outdone himself with chartbusters like ""Darshana"" and ""Onakka Munthiri"", only to be blown away by the ton of nostalgia-infused bricks that is ""Manasse Manasse"" and the heartwarming ""Nagumo"".Veteran editor Ranjan Abraham and again, the deft hand of Vineeth Sreenivasan must be appreciated for infusing as many as 13 songs astutely into the narrative, never letting us feel that they are out of place or jarring. In fact, they elevate most of the clutch sequences, especially an exquisitely designed climax shot that is sure to stay with you long after you have left the theatres.I would be amiss if I didn't mention the exquisite coterie of supporting characters that Vineeth Sreenivasan has assembled for the film. Aswath Lal as Arun's best friend ""Abraham"" and Kalesh Ramanand as ""Selva"" are the standout performers, generating some of the best emotional moments in the film while Aju Varghese and Johny Antony deliver genuine laugh-out-loud moments to add a humour dimension where the story would have otherwise seemed to drift a bit.Ultimately, Hridayam is a mesmeric, nostalgia-laden coming-of-age musical that warms the soul. Master director in Vineeth Sreenivasan has managed to design a character that is tailor-made to fit Pranav Mohanlal's strengths and the young actor has, in turn, put in an earnest performance that ranks right up there with Prithviraj in ""Classmates"" (2006) or Nivin Pauly in ""Thattathin Marayathu"" (2012).Highly recommended! A theatre watch is ideal to really enjoy the music and to genuinely ""feel"" this exquisite Vineeth Sreenivasan masterpiece!",8/10,Hridayam
suragmnair,19 February 2022,There are better ways of wasting money & time,"Such a waste movie!!! And if someone says it's romantic..feel good etc etc... I would definitely recommend them to watch 40 year old realistic love stories in Malayalam like Sukhamodevi.. Namuku paarkam mundiri thopukal..Thoovanathumbikal.. Or even Nina... Or watch Cast Away..Forrest Gump.. Catch a fire etc!!Vineeth Sreenivasan should have picked a better plot than trying to glorify a normal college life through BGM and cinematography!!!BGM is the only thing I enjoyed in this movie...

ssunny-social,4 March 2022,A Nepotistic Jam,"Hridayam is terrible. It's a nepotistic jam, directed by the legendary Srinivasan's son, male lead acted by the legendary Mohanlal's son and female lead by the legendary Priyadarshan's daughter. This is clearly a mass manipulative voting that got it to 8.6/10 in 5.5k IMDb votes because nothing about is as special as an above-average film. It is trying to present a coming of age story of the protagonist, Arun and is filled with pretentious cliched dramatic philosophical moments that is thrown once in a while as if we are being schooled on the Poetry of Life by Professor Lame. The songs shot mostly as a montage don't have any vibe and the film floats aimlessly in the wind until it lands on a pile of crap.

galaxyjustinskywalker,26 January 2022,Terrible. Please read this before you pay for this.,"This review will save your time and money. Specifically, 2 hours and 55 minutes.Plain and simple, the movie is trash. With all due respect to Vineeth Sreenivasan, please do not turn into a Mollywood Karan Johar. We don't need another of that.I would give it a 0/10. But there are 2 exact things I liked in the movie. The music, and the cinematography. The editing and shots taken are very good. Nothing groundbreaking though.Coming to those who say it brought back their engineering days. Brothers and sisters, I am an engineering graduate from a National engineering college, this is NOT how it is. Ragging isn't like this. Love doesn't work this way. Toxic relationships will do nothing but mess up your life. Friendships are never this platonic.The movie uses a countless number of cliches. A differently abled college peon, a warden everyone hates, evil seniors, innocent juniors, a breakup phase which is about 7% accurate, and the normal ""the MC goes for a journey by himself for self discovery and all of a sudden he's a purely innocent and good hearted snowflake with a sudden entrepreneurial spirit. Sure.Humour. Zero. If any of the terrible ass jokes in this movie made you laugh, you have a very very low threshold of humour.Romance. The cliche. Ex-girlfriend is reminded of her INSANELY TOXIC RELATIONSHIP seeing him getting married, and feels emotionally broken. I hate movies like these spreading a false image of love or marriage throughout young minds. Might I also add that every girl who is supposed to be percieved as ""beautiful"" is fair and every mediocre girl, especially one from the poor neighborhood, is dark? Okay?Pranav Mohanlal. Brother, I don't know if your father forced you into this. If he did, get out of this. Immediately. Take your own advice from this film and find your passion. Because acting isn't one of them. Every dialogue you delivered felt like someone was holding up the script for you. Couldn't even make up to 0.06% of the acting your father did at your age. Please. Stop.Overall, do not watch this movie. I was counting the minutes till it ended. I was drinking water to pass the time. The only thing I enjoyed was the drive to the theatre and back home. Enikk thettupatti, ningalkk pattaruth. Paisa yo samayamo kalayaruth.",2/10,Hridayam
deepthipaul,18 February 2022,"All heart, no soul.","Not a bad movie, not a great movie, and definitely not a movie worth an 8+ rating! Hridayam had nothing fresh to offer story-wise or technically. There were only two scenes in the entire movie where one feels for the characters. The performances were average, probably because none of the characters were developed enough. The songs are decent, but too many in number..it's almost as if they've used music to cover up for the lack of good scenes and dialogues.All in all, I'm just shocked that malayalees loved this very mundane and lengthy movie. Overrated for sure.

joppanLive,19 February 2022,Sorry..I don't get it,"Vineeth Srinivasan movies are all really good and worth to watch so far; 'Hridayam' is also good...but; Unfortunately, 'Hridayam' is one of the tedious watch for me among all his films. The movie is dragging a lot and should have trimmed short by at least 20-30 mins. First half is good, but by end of first half, the pace is gone and movie starts to drift towards dragging mode. Too many characters here and there, nobody really sticks other than the protagonist. Pranav is just OK as 'Arun', definitely this is his career best; but, did he be the best we can get for the character 'Arun'? Not, sure. All the songs were good and the song snippets come here and there, which is fine as it is gelled nicely into the overall theme of the movie. Overall, 'Hridayam' is worth a watch, but definitely not the best from Vineeth Srinivasan. Also, difficult to justify the imdb rating of 8.5+ for 'Hridayam'. Watch it and feel yourself.

vijayan-rohit,19 February 2022,Time to call a spade a spade,"Let's be honest .. there are so many cringe moments in the movie that you tried to ignore so that we can somehow convince overselves to believe that Mohanlals son has improved his acting skills ...there are so many characters in the movie who just come and go and we are not able to feel a connect to them and their dialogues.. the guy who died in between was there for 5 scenes and his death was supposed to make us feel sad but we don't feel a thing ... the girl whom he romances after Dharshana ditched him had 3 scenes in total with him .. everyone is fighting for screen time even when the story is 3 hours long .. how can this be ...? There is a guy who keeps his mobile on the table when he goes on a date just to get messages from his other lovers when he steps out ...
there were many instances where the movie could have turned serious .. when she decides to burn the clothes or if the wedding got cancelled due to the rain .. but NO.. this was a pure happy go lucky movie to show how someone can clear arrears and marry a girl of his dreams who he wooed just by clicking few pics of her ... many people I spoke to also confirmed that the movie was just pure hype because we are not brave enough to reject the work done by these star kids ...",1/10,Hridayam

MandalBros-5,30 May 2022,about LIFE.,"I started the film after hearing that it's one of the best romantic movies, but after finishing I can say that it's not only a movie about love, it's about life. The 1st half deals with everything one experiences in his 3 or 4 years of college days. There are so many flashback sequences which worked perfectly both in 1st half and 2nd half. Music is also so beautiful in this film.One thing I want to say for those who haven't seen it yet. There is one moment when you may think it's going to be another Kabir Singh and you may leave the film there. So wait for some time, as after that the film reincarnated itself. Actually by this, Director has shown us the difference between a good and a bad companionship. Finally, it's a beautiful movie watching experience. I'll say it's a MUST WATCH.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.¬© MandalBros.",10/10,Hridayam
ajaysankart,24 January 2022,Missing those unforgettable college days,"It was superb as I am damn missing my college days. Every single piece is been taken out from malayalees who studied outside Kerala mostly in Tamil Nadu. Really missing those days.Music is mind-blowing which really good synching with situations and the feeling is unforgettable.First half is superb and second half is gets some lagging in story line. But the director done his job by covering those lag with his awesome tricks on next scenes.

Pranav is 31 now.Before the age of 31 Mohanlal had done movies like gandhi nagar 2nd street, nammukku parkan munthiri thoppukal, thalavattam, amritham gamaya, thoovanathumbikal, nadodikkatttu, mukunthetta sumithra vilikunnu, pattanapravesham, vellanakalude naadu, chithram, varavelpu, kireedam, vandanam, dasaratham, aye auto, akkara akkara akkare, thazhvaaram, dhanam, bharatham, kilukkam, abhimanyu etc. How can anyone say that Pranav can even act if one has seen the works of his father.This overhype culture is ruining it all.

mailnairvi,20 February 2022,Average movie with continuous attemps at nostalgic trips,"As an Indian, I'd like to say that Indians have destroyed the credibility of IMDb. There is no script here. Just a guy which just has the universe working out the best for him. He asks the name, gets a gf, immediately has performances clubbed with her. Sits in a bus, gets a job. He has a 10 year old but his friend is still stuck in the same college timezone with same cheap lines. The whole movie is made to glorify a very down to earth bus such a good guy kind of person. By the end you only get multiple forced nostalgic trips.. keeps going back to college friends and college. Nothing else comes up in his life.

kavyajayabhavan,20 February 2022,Can't really get this overhype,I am genuinely sad about the malayali audience who gave this high rating for a movie which was just below average. I don't understand whether it's the problem with the people or is it that they just can't distinguish between what is worth or not worth these days.The movie lacked in a decent script. There was no sufficient character development in most roles. And there was even a lot of unwanted characters popping in between and then they were gone just like that.There was a lot of lag especially in the second half. Pranav as an actor was pathetic. I haven't watched any of his movies before so can't compare whether he has improved or not. Many a times I found him delivering dialogues as if he was reading an essay.And his expressions were miserable esp when he was ragged he was making expressions like a 2 yr child.Kalyanis acting was also bad. She was just cute in looks nothing more.Darshana was the only one who did justice to their roles.The movie was just colorful and relatable to guys who took btech but it lacked in its depth. I felt as if so many parts of a jigsaw puzzle was clubbed together with a lot of gaps disorder.,1/10,Hridayam
Hari_,22 January 2022,Middling experience,"Just another Vineeth Sreenivasan cinema. I was completely hooked towards the interval. But struggled after a point due to the writing which was a bit clumsy and relied too much on its music. Has some good moments,Great Music and Pranav has redeemed himself, nothing more.

maneshdominic-649-754864,27 January 2022,9 rating is on over hype,"For me a 9 rating is way over hyped. It was too long and boring at times. The first half was total cliche and the second half dint have much stuff. However the charactor darshana, and her performance is outstanding. Pranav is way better than his intial movies.But at the end i felt the movie just hollow and reminded me the director's first movie malarvadi arts club. One extra star for the performance of Darsana.

kmkailasnath,25 January 2022,Not even close to be a one-time watchable movie,"First of all, the movie lasts for 3 hours, plus, the story is too lagging with no links and connections to actually what is happening. The director was not able to bring about ""the feel"" - no emotions were expressed better, everything felt artificial. Not even a single scene succeed to make us laugh. The movie clearly fails to impart the nostalgic feeling it was supposed to give. Many scenes were totally cringe and unrealistic.I was glad that i could get out of the theater after the long 3 hours.Music direction and some frames were pretty good. But those doesn't make the movie close to a better one.Can't believe how this movie is over-rated!!

ajaycfg,24 January 2022,IMDB Ratings for Malayalam movies have been devalued,"I have always felt that Vineet's movies are rather shallow, with flaky characters and this one is also true to form. Lots of songs and drama, but nothing to write home about. Even though the movie shows the protagonist's life over a decade, you cannot call it a coming of age movie, as the characters never really grow up.Vineeth has looked up the standard-moving-making-recipe and added all the listed ingredients - hero, comic sidekick (and lest you miss it, the sidekick is introduced as an 'alavalathy' to drive home the point!), beautiful heroines (not one but two), romance, songs (15 no less), colours, et al, but the ingredients fail to jell and the movie falls flat. I felt no emotion, as if the movie lacked a soul. He could easily have chopped off at least 30 minutes - would have made a definite improvement.P. S: IMDB ratings for Indian movies have ceased to excite or impress as the fans associations run riot even before the movie is released, often handing out nothing less than 10 stars for even the most mediocre of movies! Why are some of the poorest Malayalam movies scoring better than the best Hollywood movies? Obviously, in our over-zealousness to boost the rating of our favourite star/movie, we are gradually devaluing the rating system! Perhaps it is a reflection of the high unemployment rate in India?",5/10,Hridayam
spicy_bee,28 February 2022,A little too much,"This movie tries its best to milk the nostalgia trend. It tries to cover a lot in a long movie which felt too stretched out. Good performances by the lead characters but not enough by side characters. Movie repeats a lot of cliche scenes and builds on the success of past nostalgia based movies.Overall wasn't too excited after spending 3 hours of my weekend on this movie.

PenFriendWentToMovies,24 January 2022,An Upbeat Campus Movie On Personal Growth..,"Hridayam was not a romantic movie as I thought it would be. For me it was more of a coming of age drama. It was a feel good movie, and Vineeth Srinivasan delivered as usual. Even though Pranav had improved as an actor, I believe there were times when he couldn't do justice to his character and it's development. Because of that certain moments failed to reach out to the audience, as it were supposed to. Darshana and Kalyani were positive attributes of the movie. I loved watching Kalyani on this. The movie is worth a watch and few good songs, funny and nostalgic moments makes it so.

pinkstar-58858,29 January 2022,A very average movie,"Very very average movie. I don't know why is it so hyped. Other than Pranav there's nothing else to look up to. I could not find any love story between darshana and pranav. It's weird they failed to show the chemistry of this so called deep bomd. Casting could be much better. The feel is missing in the entire movie. I hope vineeth comes with better scripts.

firozfazal,4 March 2022,Not worthy of the hype,"Seems like a kid wrote first half of the movie. One minute the protagonist is in deep love with a woman and in the next, he is flirting with (in script writer's words) a charakku. Pranav has to go a long way to become a hundredth of what his father is. If it wasn't for nepotism he wouldn't be a protagonist in any movie. Kalyani's cuteness is becoming over rated. Darshana has done an excellent job, as always.Worth one time watch if you go at it without expectations but not at all deserves an 8.6 rating.

The film have so many clich√©s and predictable scenes but that was not a big negative. The songs are the main positive of the film and the performance of the major cast was good especially darshana and aswath lal he have a good future ahead. Pranav was so good in it he is improved alot and kalyani also. This vineeth sreenivasan magic wouldn't dissapoint you go and watch it.

variersubin,19 February 2022,Sheer waste of 3 precious hours of your life,"Non sense subject.No objective in the movie.Neither hridayam (heart) wins nor does it helps in achieving something.Few random characters like his friend, mentor, ex gf, are of no importance at all.First half is torture, second half is death.Go waste your time and money only if you are a college couple waiting for revisiting your love life which is not gonna have any future or if you are settled in life and really want to see how well you are living your life now.Basically, this movie taught us, WHAT NOT TO BE DONE IN YOUR LIFE!!",1/10,Hridayam
benabraham,23 January 2022,Just another misinterpretation of college life outside kerala,"Firstly Pranav is doing comparatively better than his last outings. I'm not sure if he is passionate about acting and there is a good chance that A10 is holding a gun to his head and making him do this. This movie is a 3h playlist that doesn't do justice to the life of students staying outside. I mean where were the stoners, where is the trips we would take, where were the parties we would host. TBH vineeth had a lot of material to work with but he chose to show the lamest parts of college life like a failed love story and people being on only alcohol and stereotyping people who drink alcohol as no good losers who can't clear engineering which maybe true about some people but most of the people who drinks and smoke up actually graduate and get a job. Coming to the second half...welll... you can skip it. You can just walk out after the first half and you won't miss a thing. Overall this movie is a pass. Better than watching this you can just switch on the playlist while you are free or doing something.

Akshay_mg,22 January 2022,Not a Thattathin Marayath,"Eventhough Pranav has made noticeable improvements in his acting many places and his dialogue delivery felt like he is just reading the dialogues.Hesham Abdul Wahab needs to appreciated beyond any comparison. It's his music that makes the movie worth every second.Many characters felt unwanted even the parent of our protagonist,they just got casted because the writer didn't want Arun as an orphan.If you are looking for a normal time pass movie I strongly recommend this one.

SivakumarBalachandran,11 February 2022,Vineeth Srinivasan's Hridayam makes sure it touches the viewers Hridayam.,"My take on Hridayam translates as ""Heart"" - Though it's a simple title but sometimes they say Simple is more powerful, I guess that's what has worked for this magical masterpiece on screen.This is a romantic coming of age story of Arun Neelakandan (beautifully essayed by Pranav Mohanlal) and how his life transpires through various People he meets, incidents that happened in his life and off course his love interest shape him as a person.Ok I know it's a regular coming of age story we have seen in so many movies of similar genre, that's easy and said but Director Vineeth Sreenivasan makes sure he delivers his mark in this soulful tale that unfolds on big screen leaves all your emotions turned.This close to 3 hours long movie might sound like a long affair to sit and watch but a quirky and engaging screenplay makes sure mostly you don't get that thought.Performances - All three leads deliver what's exactly needed for the role they look naturally the character which is a testimony to their craft. Pranav Mohanlal as Arun emoted almost every node of the emotional graph and gave his character life. Darshana Rajendran plays Darshana a beautiful curly haired girl next door seemed effortless in her role delivers strong with her subtle emotions. Kalyani Priyadarshan as Nithya is your cute software angel will make sure boys go crazy with her cuteness but that doesn't shy away her acting skills equally shows all range of expressions especially when showing the sense of insecurity in loosing your loved one to another person. I have to say if these main characters must live and shine the support should be strong and that's what we get from the supporting cast characters Antony Thadikaran, Jimmy, Maya, Lachu Patti, Selva, Ironing girl Selvi, Kedar. Everyone did their role with full justice.Music - Lets talk about the elephant in the room, yes songs and BGM from this movie makes the Music director the real hero of the film. Hesham Abdul Wahab on his Debut as music director his soundscape gives the life to the story. I cannot think of this movie without the songs and BGM which were soul stirring. Lyrics by Arun Aalat were so powerful and beautiful that connects to your heart.Cinematography - May it be the college life or the city scape Viswajith the cinematographer transfers the viewers to their world for a subtle yet immersive experience. Make sure to catch this move on big screens it's not always the Avatar's that need big screen sometimes as simple as our day-to-day life story can do magic on screen.Overall a definite solid coming of age story with lots of fun, sadness, anger, betrayal, passion, love, friendship, and Romance at its heart Vineeth Srinivasan's Hridayam makes sure it touches the viewers Hridayam.An easy 8.5 on 10 movie.NB: I watched it twice before reviewing üòä-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran.",9/10,Hridayam
nahmahakeem,23 January 2022,Magic of Appu and Vineeth,"This success is actually a teamwork. Kudos to Appu who gave excellent acting and tremendous improvement in his performance..Also Darshana and Kalyani was good. Handsome Appu and beautiful Kalyani have a beautiful chemistry between them. Appu became the heartthrob of young girls.. Good work..Keep going guys ... Expecting more such films. Obviously this film will bring the career graph of Appu and Vineeth to next level... Have a great success ahead..

SAMTHEBESTEST,25 February 2022,"A wannabe subtle film wanders too much for no reason, yet this ruined romance goes on telling one subtle lesson.","Hridayam (2022) :
Brief Review -A wannabe subtle film wanders too much for no reason, yet this ruined romance goes on telling one subtle lesson. I always say that romance is one of the dumbest genres. Many films that could have been classics have been ruined by these dumb romantic things. Of course, I don't expect every romantic drama to be a logical masterpiece like 'Sunrise' (1927) or 'Casablanca' (1942), I mean, that's too much. It's nearly impossible. I never really understood why people have overhyped so many romantic flicks in the last 70 years, because the real diamond-plated classics came before the 1950s. Once in a while, we get to see eternal love sagas like 'Veer Zaara' (2004) or to remind you of the recent Telugu masterpiece, ""C/o Kancharapalem"" (2018). I could never accept that those desperate people went on to overhype films like 'Premam' (2015) and '96' (2018). In the first 30 mins of Hridayam, I said to myself, ""Oh god, this seems like a stuff made for the duffers who liked Arjun Reddy / Kabir Singh, and I'll have to go on with this for 140 mins more."" Thank God, it changed the routes. For what? Nothing. I thought it would try some life-lessons now, but then it had to give sneak peeks into the same boring romance. ""Where is this going?"" I asked myself. Then I remembered the Marathi film ""Ti Sadhya Kay Karte"" (2017) and found Hridayam closest to it. The same thoughts with a few extensions and one subtle thought that one must not repeat the same mistake again. Better tell the truth than hiding it when you are in love. That's all there is to it. Nothing else. The college days nostalgia and all, we have seen that in hundreds of films, so please don't over-praise it for that. Hridayam is messy, but recovers, thankfully. It definitely makes a good one-time watching experience for all kinds of audiences with the help of good performances and steady direction. The only problem is that it's too long and scattered in places.RATING - 6.5/10*",6/10,Hridayam
beevenkat,28 January 2022,Do watch malayalam movie #Hridayam in cinemas,"1 star for #PranavMohanlal - he is the son of actor Mohanlal - but let's not dismiss him as another insufferable star kid - he delivers an affable performance - 1 star for convincing depiction of college life - this is how an educational institution looks like - this is how students actually conduct themselves - 1 star for music director Hesham Abdul Wahab for composing music which perfectly matches the mood of the film - songs which don't assault the ears. Watch malayalam movie #Hridayam in cinemas. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Rating 3/5.

shijeshbal,29 January 2022,3 words..Over hyped.. Shallow..Cliche...Just heart no mind at work,"Spoilers ahead..At the heart of the film named heart there is nothing. A shallow love story happens between hero and heroine . All cliche elements like a hero who is best in everything, a not so fair skinned fit for nothing assistant , artificial comedies , a villain who is a womanizer and gets beating to make us laugh.. like a slapstick comedy. A tamil character(selva) to work out sentiments who dies in the middle just to make us cry .. A lover assigned to him to make it even more interesting.. His name serves just one purpose , to give it to the baby who will be born later..( I saw it coming when they were naming the new born.. ). To add to the cliche ness we have a secret alley which actually has nothing interesting in store ..then a heavy lag in the middle without any interesting thing happening.. At the second half usual family drama with marriages etc.. Not much notable transformation in the character of the characters are shown. And finally a happy ending without any mentionable events.. A film which anybody could have penned..we dont need vineeth for this.. Below normy stuff just over hyped..After watching the film I was honestly thinking what happened to people, is it fandom, extreme promotions or simply has covid destroyed the audiences's ability to differentiate better and worse..",4/10,Hridayam
thasnizab,26 January 2022,Feel good,"Expected a-lot from Vineeth. But didn't come to the expectations. First half was pure bliss. But felt lagging from there after.Good songs and nice direction. But vineeth should concentrate more on the script. Felt bad sometimes.Main character's performance was average. His expressions were same. Shane Nigam was more suited to this character. There are many talented artists but don't know why good directors choosing star-kids in their movies.Pranav seems like innocent and a shy kid. He must concentrate on his expressions and physical appearance. His physical appearance was same through the whole movie. There was no visible changes in his appearance.!

aishwaryast,29 January 2022,A normal movie with good songs. Literally Overhyped.,"I loved the songs more than anything in the movie. The musician Hisham is absolutely talented with unique style of composition. His songs are fresh. When I felt boring and thought of moving out of the theatres, the Manasse song made me happy. That song was amazing.The acting of Darshana was splendid. Pranav has also done well. Kalyani given an okay feel only; just an another character not needing much acting skills. Johny Antony again scored well with his timing of comedy dialogues.The movies gives you many stereotypical and dramatic scenes, dialogues. The duration of movie was a problem for me. I felt it lagging, mostly in the second half. They could have edited the scenes of the fraud Kedhar. The Hindi song scene was also unwanted. The script also fails to give a perfect definition of Arun-Darshana relationship. ""Love at first sight"" feels like more cliches these days. The first scene where Arun recognising Antony as the stupid fellow was unconvincing.(An example of having preconceptions about a person by his looks.)Movie also gives nostalgic feelings, especially about the college days.

mmanojkumar,24 February 2022,No substance movie with terrible acting by the lead actor,"A very overhyped movie with no substance. The only saving graces are the acting of Darshana and the music throughout the film. The story is superficial, no depth to the characters. I was unable to relate to any of them.Speaking of acting, Pranav Mohanlal cannot act. Period. His acting was such a distraction for me that I had to concentrate hard whenever he was on screen. Dialogues felt like being read out from a piece of paper. Overall, the imdb ratings for this movie are nowhere near justified. Definitely looks like Vineeth wanted to create his on version of Premam with generous borrowings from Classmates, his own Anandam etc and failed miserably.

Please don't see this, otherwise your life would also be ruined like 90s movies ruined ours.Too many things going at once.

kevinshimo2005,21 February 2022,One time watch entertainer!,"First half of the movie was bit real and people can somewhat correlate with the movie and develop a connection. The hero moves into some weird things after first breakup. Then he picks up by taking an effort. But second half was meant for an audience who prefer entertainment over reality. Everyone gets placed and none of them prefers engineering profession. The hero becomes a photographer and without any struggle he succeed in life. Even after so much of success, hero and heroine only travels in second class train. All the college friends come for hero's wedding. No much of life struggles, the movie went. Too much of optimism in the movie.

Songs are good but it's too much musical! Watched it in theatre on the second week after seeing so many positive reviews but didn't like then was thinking that may be I have some problem for not liking it! Waited for OTT release, then saw many negative reviews so it was all a hype about this movie.

prince_c3,24 February 2022,A Nostalgic Journey from College life to Adult life,"Well, this is my third or fourth Malayam Movie and I am starting to feel that South Indian industry is more to offer than Bollywood baseless movies these days. In this age and era, Tamil, Telugu and Malyalam producers and directors bringing stories from 90s and early 2000s, which attract large crowd base like me, who can relate to these movies because we grow up in 90s and we proudly call ourself 90s kids.Having said that, the editor of this movie could do a better job and edit the movie by shortening it at least 20-25 mins and then, it could be really a masterpiece of Engineering college life into adulthood.Can't imagine they showed a scene where he lied to hot chick that he is not committed or having a steady girlfriend, how many times we did, so many times, likewise there were so many scenes where it touches the practical chords. Like lying to wife that meeting a college friend, which in fact happened to be an ex-girl friend from college. Re-union parties after 10 and 15 years where your eyes were looking for that one person which never showed up or when showed up you don't want to face.The strong points of this movie.1. Overall story and theme of Engineering College life, showed very close to the real life, like canteen, student life, dorm life, flirting and when you think you finally found a girl with whom you can spend the rest of your life only to end in tragedy.2. The Music by Hesham Abdul Wahab, to be honest, I never heard of his name or anything, but, after I finished the movie, I felt like there is something which make this movie awesome, even though it's too long, what it was...well, yes, I got it, it was soothing, composing and almost divine like music by Wahab, now I am going to look for his other work.3. Acting, well, everyone deserves a thumbs up, Pranav even though the leading cast of Pranav and Kalyani are the son and daughter of Malayam top actor and director, but they really have talent. Pranav was good in his role, Kalayani was good for what it required of her, she almost introduced half way through, but she justified cuteness factor and then, moving into a wife and mother in a small span of allocated time. Darshana really did an awesome job of a girlfriend to good friend to a jealous friend and finally took the life as it comes and that's the reality of life.The weak point.Length of the movie. For close to 3 hours is too much, if its edited to two and half hours then it would be great.Well, the reason for this review is because this movie is very close to my heart, because it seems like I was just watching my life on screen. In fact, I have been asked to watch this movie by a few of my Engineering college friends who were not only close friends of mine and they still are, they know about my love life and they played a good part in it, unfortunately, my ending is very similar and they in fact told me, did I write the story?If I wrote the story, it would be very similar.If you want to re-visit your Engineering and college life go watch.",7/10,Hridayam
gokilnair,21 January 2022,One of the Best Malayalam Movie <3,"Every single minute in the movie was worth the watch. The minute details and the dialogues are extra ordinary. Entire Casting is fantastic and not to forget each of them have given their 100% and that is purely visible in this movie. Darshana is great throughout the movie. However nothing can beat the combo of Pranav and Kalyani. They make us all fall in love and it's just so perfect. Pranav totally remind us about the old Lalettan and he proves that he has got it in him and surely lived upto the expectation. A great applauds to Vineeth for gifting us such a beautiful Movie. It's one of the best movie in the recent times. Once again Arun & Nithya stole our heart. Loved the movie and hope everyone watch the movie in the theaters itself.

and Trisha ( here between pranav and kalyani)5) Oru Vadakkan Selfie : there is a song called Kaikkottum Kandittilla ,you will feel watching this scenes in
Thathaka Theithare sequences.And also Vijayaraghavan role too6)96 : some scenes you feel this fim tooActing wise : drashana role and antony role was excellent .Movie should have avoided a scene where the train TTE tells Pranav oru allavalathi avide erikunundu ..avane kandal ariyam.... towards antony.

The character development was inadequate. With the runtime character development would have been brilliant otherwise. The movie director seemed confused on what he wanted to convey, love for the college or college sweetheart or someone else. It felt like they tried to convey something very deep by just scratching the surface. Also the lead actor could improve his acting further. I wouldn't have regretted not watching this movie.

They could have trimmed it to around 2 hours. Mohanlal's son has shown improvement but still cannot be called a good actor. The lead actresses are not worth writing about. The only good thing about the movie is the song Darshana.

drishya-02583,24 January 2022,An average movie,"In my view this film actually was a good practice to make this feels like 96 and yeah they won up to a certain limit in expressing nostalgia , I didn't feel something exciting so I can't say the merit. The negatives includes over duration (3hr ) , the plot is great but the story is lagged , the director failed to make a clear pictured outline of the 1st half , and also he failed to express the intensity of the situations in the story , he failed to express the intense sentiments , romance , college fights etc. In its peak .The story is itself predictable in the way director narrates. The performance of pranav, kalyani, darshana and a random guy who speaks hindi was good(good only) . The actor who played the character Antony thadikaran was not up to the mark he also failed in expressing sentiments and the audience can feel it as a drama . I feel the film like an over rated one as I'm also an engineering student who passed through all the situations mentioned in it . Moving to the end of the film , I didn't feel anything interesting and as an audient I wanted to quit the film before its ending time due to the over lagging of content.I could able to relate some sequence to the movie to 'sillinu oru kaadhal' , if you never watched the film 'sillinu oru kadhal' , I highly recommend to watch it .My rating is 6.3/10 (and its worth the ticket value only to a 30% of all hype)
And kindly respect my review , this might be the honest one you find on the web .",6/10,Hridayam
tkmce2008,20 February 2022,A coming of age drama that boasts of a brilliant cast and 15 mesmerising songs,"Vineeth Sreenivasan's returns to the director's chair with the coming of age film, #hridayam. This 3 hour Magnum opus about life is a musical extravaganza.Hridayam is the story of Arun Neelakandan; a boy who travels to Chennai for his further studies. Here he meets Dharshana & falls head over heels for her. The films then goes on to narrate various incidents in Arun's life; his friends, his family & in the second half; his career & married life.Pranav Mohanlal essays the role of Arun. With his boyish looks & innocence; Pranav is a perfect fit for the role of Arun. The challenges he faces during his life change him a lot & Pranav proves that he is capable of handling these scenarios onscreen. Darshana Rajendran is mesmerising as always. She gets to really sink her teeth into this role & she shines bright! Kalyani Priyadarshan, who plays the other female lead doesn't have much to do but she seems to have improved considerably since her debut. The supporting cast is spectacular as well; standouts include Aswath Lal, Aju Varghese, Johny Antony & Kalesh Ramanand.Vineeth Sreenivasan mentioned in an interview that he wrote the story around the songs & when you watch the movie it shows you why. Hesham Abdul Wahab's songs are perfectly placed throughout the movie capturing various moments from our protagonist's life. They give the story so much more depth & meaning. 15 songs & only one needed a better picturisation.Hridayam is brilliant & it aces in every department. The cast, the songs & the visionary director/storyteller in a film that is high on nostalgia & memorable moments. One of my favourites from 2022 & a movie that lived up to its hype!",9/10,Hridayam
avjboyz,22 January 2022,One of the Best movie üî•,"It's been a long time since I've seen such a good movie. I missed my college life for a moment. I felt like not even a moment was taken in a boring way. Pranav Mohanlal's performance was magnificent. Everyone did their part very well. Vineeth Sreenivasan shows us that a film can be made in such a good way without any mass or class. What we get after watching this movie is a positive thinking. I would like to thank everyone who was a part of this film for giving us such a great film. All the songs in this movie are very interesting and pleasant to listen to.

grarunkumar1994,7 February 2022,Musical Journey through life .,"""Hridayam"" is a well written, well crafted musical journey of life. The past present and future are told seamlessly.Vineeth Sreenivasan- his writing and direction- has come a long way from ""Malarvadi Arts Club"" and ""Thattathin Marayathu"" yet still maintains the spark that made us love his work. His films too are travelling through his life. More mature thoughts and more serious approach towards life.His films ooze happiness and optimism- here too, it just makes you feel emotions suppressed inside and gives hope for future.Hesham Abdul Wahab- the music composer deserves an applause. His 14 songs flow through the film as a single stream with the story. That was something magical.The cinematography too was bright colourful and full of life- apt for the filmThis film is a mix of all right ingredients baked into perfection by a master chef.Not to be missed.",9/10,Hridayam

sureshpmithala,17 April 2022,Highly overrated and cliched,"Really disappointed this movie has a 8.4 rating on imdb, there is nothing new in this movie and and too lengthy. Music is definitely good. The performances are average, nothing that stands out. Also, there is the avoidable Tamil emotional masala added in for wooing the Tamil mass.There have been far too many movies with the same theme, it is time they reimagine the story line.

cerelacholmes,19 February 2022,A slice of life movie with a heart,"When everybody said that the movie had a running time of nearly 3 hours and had 15 songs, I was skeptic to watch the movie but eventually I decided to watch it. Man that was the best decision I ever made that day. Like the name, the movie is full of heart and I was glued to the movie. Songs , characters and cinematography boosted a cliched story. Most of the scenes were predictable and are already seen in most slice of life movies but the treatment and Vineeth's decision to take it as a musical is the winner. I have a habit of giving a movie 10/10 when it glues the eyes to the screen. This one did.

This time its special as it will be marked as the rise of Pranav Mohanal from just an actor to a nuanced artiste...Freshness in its plots and story progression is being retained throught the film. Owing to the strong character development done, it is not just 'Arun' which Pranav plays , but almost all the characters took a sweet spot in the 'Hearts' of the audience . It is mesmerizing how people of all age groups can easily relate to various scenes in the movie with their own experiences ,even though it can be tagged as a one portraying youth life.As the cherry on top , 15 magical tunes from 'Hesham' makes this whole film a memorable and touching musical journey for the audience .Rating 3.5 /5.",9/10,Hridayam

madhupill2002,22 January 2022,Nostalgic!!,"Watched HRIDAYAM yesterday risking Covid in PVR nearby! A cute movie. Music is awesome. All 15 songs are souls stirring. Memories of college days and even school days came back. I think PRANAV's best movie. Darshana and Kalyani did awesome work. High on Emotion.(don't CRY)I think ladies acted better than their male counterpart. It may be a reason being a fan of Mohanlal there is an automatic tendency to like the acting of his son too. But he tried well. And full mark to Vineet Srinivasan and the music. One song even sung by Raju also good!!Go for it if you want to live your college days.

natureboy-84907,29 January 2022,Hridayam - Lovely HeART,"No wonder the movie is named Hridayam, this one directly deals with your heart and memories . Reminds us about lot of blissful moments we would have either experienced or witnessed in our lives . Like the beats for the heart , the music is for this movie . The soulful music makes the movie experience an awesome one . The length of the movie is definitely a cause of concern and would have been more crisp and dramatic with some more concentration on editing aspect . Back to the story and cast , Pranav Mohanlal does his best and ensures his portion interesting to watch . With continuously appearing in quite a handful movies , kalyani Priyadarshan has that smiling face and eyes to remember for long . She's all loaded with lots of energy and acting skills . No wonder movies are in her genes . And here comes my new favourite Darshana Rajendran , you beauty . Thanks to the director for bringing a song in her name which is always on a repeat mode on my amazon . Darshana is all about emotions and expressions , her eyes n smiles does those brilliantly . If not for her and that name probably the movie wouldn't have had so much positivity and beauty . Worth watching the movie just for her . And then comes the real heart of this Hridayam , the music . The movie didn't lack a bit of music or songs , it was plentiful and greatly done by Hesham Abdul Wahab. The storyline is simple and common but definitely relatable by most of us to some part of our life . I repeat , Malayalam movie makers are from different planet all together only they can make simple ones looks grandeur . Thanks to Director Vineeth Sreenivasan for such a gem of a movie . This movie needs to be watched in theatres or in bigger screens with good sound output to indulge more . Getting out of Darshana mode is going to be tougher. Overall , this Hridayam is sure to win many hearts .",10/10,Hridayam

joey-83609,3 February 2022,Vineeth Sreenivasan's Masterpiece of Musical storytelling with Nostalgia packed in every scene,"This is one of the best films I've seen, a sweeping love story about a young romance succumbing to the stark realities of college life and the inevitability of growing up and the romance after. We've all felt much like the three main characters of this film-hopeful, alive, full of love, heartbreaks, depression and optimism. There isn't a feeling quite like young love, the college life that fleeting span of time when you believe everything is right in the world and nothing could possibly go wrong. Whether or not that is something that will last is different for everyone, but as this movie shows, that feeling is one of a kind, and we come to a realization this what our life is and the ones beside you is your life.

ratheeburning,29 January 2022,A movie that brought back the memories.,"This movie can be related closely for anyone ever been to a different state for studies. The movie has brought back almost all the memories of College life be it Love,friendship, fights, seniors, The places that make it memorable, The bonds that keep us going.Pranav has really acted well in the movie, The innocence of a first year year student and the way we transform with time into someone else along the way with all the experiences and people that we meet.The glimpses of various scenes will surely remind you of many things.The movie felt like a poetry, The way it is expressed. Very minute things that seems normal in a hostel life but different to someone never been is actually highlighted.For someone who had experiences similar to the story portrayed for being a different state, This would really feel god.The movie has a positive feel to it.This is not meant for people waiting to just scream and dance for a movie. This isn't a movie of celebrating the actor. This is a movie of celebrating the path we been through, and Pranav really made a lasting impact the way he portrayed the character.The movie isn't the success of one, but many co stars too those had their own space for expression. It has the funny side, a little violence, the love, the beauty, Good direction, Good songs... I don't know what more should be expected.Again reiterating, Not meant for people who celebrate actors and have no sense of story or direction.",10/10,Hridayam
gr123,26 January 2022,Solid Vineeth Srinivasan Movie,"Vineeth Srinivasan has done an excellent directing this movie. Cinematography really stands out and music is also really good. Actors also did a decent job. Definitely the best role Pranav Mohanlal has done. But at the end of the day, I think the movie comes together because of Vineeth Srinivasan's work. I don't think I ever got bored, even though the movie was long.

chanjumerly,24 January 2022,Makes you happy from within,"This movie, I would recommend this to everyone and not just the malayali because I don't want others to miss out on what I felt by watching this movie. From the beginning to the interval and starting from there to the end, it's a rush of feelings, happiness, satisfaction, anger, sad everything. It's been long since i saw a movie that evoked all these feelings in me. I laughed, I cried and when I left the theatre I felt joy. Other than this, the movie keeps giving good message to our generation on how to behave and how to handle certain situation. As a woman I can say that even if the protogonist was a man, it very much gave justice to all the women charecter. And shout out to all the supporting charecter... Amazing work.

Some have some bitter experience also.But, This movie shows a general expected life on College and after that.Some Love stays forever like 96 movie.

Language: Malayalam

RECOMMENDEDSuperb romantic drama set on college backdrop. The songs are adding more value to the movie. The first half is racy and fun to watch. The second half is lagging the pace compared to first half. Looks like its dragged bit more to give space for Kalyani Character.The best part is that they kept the first love from the beginning to the end, even in climax.Worth the watch.

saru2020,20 August 2022,decent life-ography with poor heroine selection,"The film takes us through the life of the protagonist and his journey in career & life in a loosely coupled way which is watchable but just like the other mallu films, this film is also a slow one and we see the lead roles' lives' developing in front of us and yet it gives a feeling of nothing so touching or emotional, it just feels like yet another film, otherwise cinematography was good with slow motions added in required portions, music was good enough for the kinda content still it could've been better.Heroines selection could've been better, Kalyani was beautiful but the other one isn't and didn't suit the role either with her kinda performance it just spoiled the film and probably if that role would've been replaced by someone like Krithi Shetty or some modern heroine, it might've done wonders to the film.

sreeharimovielover-78639,30 January 2022,An Amazing Slice of Life movie!!,"Gotta give credit to Vineeth for taking all the risks into bringing this masterpiece in the big screen. The 3 main winners of this movie were-Screenplay,Songs and performances. Although the movie is 3 hours long you will never feel a lag for a minute. But he has delivered a movie for the future superstars in Mollywood.Hesham was really good with the songs and I think he is gonna make it big in the near future.Pranav Mohanlal,man what a performance! He really nailed it with Arun and if you ask me this is his career best performance. The rise of Pranav Mohanlal is imminent.Darshana also provided a solid performance. I think she like Pranav lived her character and there was certainly a good chemistry between him and Pranav.A few days back when I saw BroDaddy, though I liked the movie, I really did not like the character of Kalyani Priyadarshan. She could have been utilised much better. And in this movie Vineeth utilised her perfectly. That cute and bubbly character was the icing on the cake that was already Amazing.All in all, A movie you should watch with your family and friends and after watching it you will definitely not be disappointed.",10/10,Hridayam

Kalyani- Great acting
Pranav-Kalyani jodi is awesome to watch
Darshana- Great Acting too.Film was bit lengthy. Some of the scenes coule have been avoided.Vineeth is brilliant director but he didnt do well in few places. He tried to make his life as it is on the screen, without thinking about audience and whether people will like it or not.Too much music. Not all songs are good except 2-3. Every scene they tried to have music and it was overkill. At places they wven repeated same song again and again with same lyrics.

anveshaws,13 August 2022,Finest movie with Culture and a good thriller,"1st thing to say screenplay and direction are too good. From very 1st scene you will be engaged to the story . For every 15-20 mins of story building there will be sudden thrilling scenes which make audiences keep on engaged with the story. The location are too good. Particularly the the shots in snow are too awesome. Nikhil the hero done good job. Anupama is good with in her role. Srinivas Reddy & viva Harsha comedy is decent . Anupam Kher scene is outstanding. Kala Bhirava's music is just ok. And our Main Hero LORD KRISHNA drives the entire story ,just as like driving entire Bharatam. Waiting for part 3. I hope they will come up with good story and great screenplay.

amitgidh,13 August 2022,Lovely movie!!!,"Just watched this movie in Washington DC metro area and the theatre was almost house full. This movie is a mystery-thriller written on the lines of Dan Brown's novels like Da Vinci Code etc but with an Indian mythical-cultural background. I wish this movie was released Hindi dubbed in the US, as I saw the Telugu show reading subtitles :))

ajith-04112,13 August 2022,Jai shree krishna,"This movie will touch your heart in actual if you are a sanatani because the potray of lord Krishna is so perfect that you can't doubt it actor nikhil himself said that he was not the hero of this film the actual hero of this film was LOED KRISHNA which is 100% bro but the ending scene is just out of the world eagerly waiting for third part.

sastryml,5 October 2022,How to cash on gullibility of sentimental audiences,"While another recent Telugu movie Sitaramam is reasonably well done and deserves its success, It pains me to say Karthikeya2 becomes a money spinner without any major praiseworthy component.The hero apart from lacking any hero material lacks the basic acting skills. The mother overacts every scene, the heroine looks good but has only two or three expressions to offer. About the attempted humor if the supporting character, the less said the better. VFX stardands are no where near today's standards.Photography is okay, not necessarily the framing. The theme is catchy, dialogues are acceptable, but the connect between the scenes is gripping.Even if an inferior storyline is handled by a better director and starcast, the effect vwould have been far better.The makers hit a jackpot just because they thought of a catchy storyline.",5/10,Karthikeya 2

younrer,13 August 2022,Just...AMAZING,"Director Chandoo Mondeti burst on the scene with Nikhil starrer Karthikeya. Yes, the original movie marked his debut. Now years later, he has come up with a second chapter. For the uninitiated, Karthikeya 2 has nothing to do with the first part. It is a standalone film where the main lead from the first part is on a different journey. So, Karthikeya, aka Karthik, is now a doctor and taking on a new case of sorts.

mounishyalamarthi,14 August 2022,An interesting artifact,"It's about time to see the combination of mystery, thriller, religious, and scientific all in one movie with a perfect background score. Few hiccups on the comedy part, but Nikhil was bound to the storyline perfectly. The plot and screenplay were good. The casting could be a little better, the director hasn't used comedians very well.It's a kind of premium version of Gopichand's Sahasam movie but with a wonderful story. The last 1 hr was the heart of the movie. Definitely worth watching in the theatre if you are looking for some mystic story mixed with science and religion.

MandalBros-5,28 October 2022,not for ME.,"Part 1 - There's nothing to like in the film. Bad acting, full of clich√© moments, so many loopholes and most importantly unnecessary and unaffective comedy dialogues. Still couldn't stop the film in between only because of the mystery. I'll say the film is bad. After finishing the first part, I had no interest in watching part 2, but had to because of its amazing responses.Part 2 - Now, no doubt part 2 is far better than part 1 but still can't say that it's brilliant. Only because of the mythological reference I was watching till the end, otherwise I would stop it in between. While watching this type of films we audiance should surprise in moments, but I had the same expression from beginning to end of the film. Only good thing I found in part 2 is the scenes with Anupam Kher. Finally, maybe this genre is not for me or it's really not a very good film, I don't know.Karthikeya Available on YouTube, MX Player, Prime Video.Karthikeya 2 Available on ZEE5.¬© MandalBros.",5/10,Karthikeya 2

asardeshpande,23 August 2022,Half Baked film - needed more research,"Don't fall for the high ratings here as they are just for Hinduism and Lord Krishna around which the story is built - I really hope film makers use make more movies around our rich mythology (or history if proven conclusively) and pick up lesser known stories and events like these from the Puraanas, Vedas, etc to build mystery & fantasy movies around it.This movie tries to do that but fails - the story starts on a promising note, but falls apart very soon after - the mystery elements unfold far too easily, the villian and the doomsday theory is very flimsy and laughable. The 'telescope' thing had zero mystery. Anupam Khers cameo was pointless and does nothing to connect science and mythology. The acting overall is just about passable and the hero's ability to tame the snakes is not digestable - they do try to give some justification for it, but it's very half baked, just like the movie in general. I think some better reasearch would have done wonders to this film as both the mythology ('history') and the science angle fail to convince as there are no facts given and the audiences are just supposed to believe everything per se.(The discovery of submerged Dwarka, archeological artefacts recovered from Mahabharat, etc could have been used to make it more convincing). The VFX is both good and bad, the landscapes are surprisingly good given the budget of this film but then u don't watch a film for the landscapes do you (watch discovery channel instead) !Takes the mystery elements from Indiana Jones, National Treasure and Da Vinci Code which is not a bad thing (in this story context of course).Very generous 5 stars from me for the 'concept' alone.",5/10,Karthikeya 2
abhineet150,13 August 2022,Accept the fact South produces Original Indian films,"Watched the movie Kathikeya 2 and I must say we should now accept that Bollywood is on verge of losing its charm and we should give respect to South Indian films and call them ""The Indian Films"" which is long due.The film is completely entertaining with twistWith no promotion of this movie I went ahead and watched with little expectation and My O My.The film,script and the actor Nikhil,Anupama etc entertained me unlike the other bollywood biggies which failed to impress even with big stars in it.

I am talking about the movie not a dumpster.Recently i have watched many movies with good VFX, along with a TRASH story. This movie is one of them. I got excited to watch this movie as people were gossiping good about the movie. But story of this movie disappointed me... As they started with a super intelligent Dr. Who can do anything. After some incident he was suspended.. but after that movie turns into a interesting plot.. but when they found the flut on top of the mountain and this story become trash. A total garbage. They jumped into a river with a truck didn't sink? Also it got full speed in the ice.They found the ""**let"" after that what ? Where did the virus go ?Wasted my time ... I had already set a list of movies to watch. I should have watched any other one of them..""TRASH""

shibinasks,28 October 2022,Over hyped movie.,Average movie. I started with heavy expectations as the reviews were top notch. But got disappointed as i found nothing compared to the ratings. Story line is good. But i couldn't digest the fact that they relate each and everything in the epics with science facts. They are telling the solutions for all the problems in near future is simply encoded in a bracelet which is not convincing. Making is ok. But the story thread seems incomplete here and there. They are simply putting everything they cant explain as fate which is funny. I can give 5 stars for the imagination and story and nothing more.,5/10,Karthikeya 2

forthetollferry,28 August 2022,Nonsensical,"Two stars for the scenery and Hindu-themed CGI, as the rest was just grating and frankly nonsensical, with short interrupted scripts, blaring music, and phony acting. The transition between scenes is abrupt and it's almost like the objective of the film was just do whatever to make the protagonist look good, story be damned. It made me wonder if the producer and crew had ever studied cinematography or at least the art of storytelling because I think even I could produce a story that is nominally compelling, not something that just makes you eager to leave.Coming off a high from seeing Sita Ramam, I thought this would be of a similar caliber given the high rating it has. I just don't get it. Maybe it's Hindu adherents who were swayed by the religious sentiment in this film that have made it thus.

I think people are starved by not watching other movies that's why they think this is soo great and rating it so high. This was phenomenally bad and no argument can change that.

insherry,14 August 2022,A sincere effort,"Karthikeya2 is a breeze of fresh air. The story telling takes you on a fantasy rollercoaster ride seeped in reality. It's thrilling, gripping, exciting. The lead actors manage to retain their innocence. And yes #KrishnaIsTruth.

kumarpandeymanish-29072,14 August 2022,My review,"KARTHIKEYA 2 Is really amazing movie which brings positivity and also entertaint the audience That scene where anupam kher talks about Sri Krishna literal goosebumps feels more like a teaching documentary rather than a suspense mystery thriller unlike part 1.

samluha,10 October 2022,"Poor screenplay, story and direction","There is no proper flow in the story. Even the mythological connection seems off. It tried to take leaf from Indiana jones but failed miserably. There is no sense of doctor of medicine to become myth buster. The lead character is confused. In on scene, he do not believe in superstition and in the very next scene he is follower of same. Even, his introduction to main story is absurd. From nowhere, the lead character is recognized by the archeologist and all the secrets are revealed to him. It would be great, if lead actor is also an archeologist and in his quest he undermines some secrets and lead to something interesting that binds myth to modern science.

Be proud of it.üáÆüá≥,"This movie is a tight slap to those who always mocks our history as mythology.Also lesson to bollywood , if you provide good original content people will support you....Movie review :- One of the best BGM. Super screen play, Visuals are very good with low budget.Very good combination of Thrill , comedy and Adventure.Nikhil Sidharth and Anupama superb in their role. Anupam Kher's Cameo is the bumper bonus...
Many scenes will give you goosebumps for sure.

If someone is poor in expressions from Mahesh babu that would be nikhil siddhartha.... Storyline average. Poor VFX. Don't know why people are rating this average movie 10 star.. The people who are rating this movie 10 star i think they don't know much about acting, and they haven't watch many movies.. Nowadays internet is avaliable to everyone ( every section of people). Wastage of time....... IT is a good movie for those people who don't watches much movie.In India now it's trend to give 10 star to any south movie...

rohit_vit2020,23 August 2022,What a boar,Screenplay is worst. Felt like scenes are stiched. There is no proper flow in the movie. Worst acting with the kind of dialogue delibery Nikhil has got is not apt for the cultural films. I can't appreciate comedy scenes if it misses the main point. Don't fall for the herd reviews. Culturally failed film. Nikhil is not meant for serious roles. His face expressions can be digestable for the role.,1/10,Karthikeya 2
cubixtraders,22 August 2022,Poor acting with a lots of flaws in direction....,"All characters are expect anupam kher did overacting and action sequences are very awful.... Anupama just gave üòÆ this expression in whole movie. Actually this movie has made with low budget and tried to get more returns by using hindu sentiments.

This movie is a mystery-thriller written on the lines of Dan Brown's novels like Da Vinci Code etc but with an Indian mythical-cultural background. I wish this movie was released Hindi dubbed in the US, one of the best movie Santani dharm.

cadevendragulati,19 August 2022,Could have been even better,"The plot was very promising to start with, however the script lacked clarity of direction on multiple occasions. The writers could have written an excellent script on sub-merged dwarka, however that part was totally missing. The movie also tries to touch upon the scientific aspects of hinduism but fails in doing the same. More hard work and research required.

Karthikeya was awesome. The first movie was loved by all. But the second movie - karthikeya 2 movie is made to appeal only to Hindu people. So I request people of other faiths not to waste time watching this movie. There are even better movies to watch.

Stunning action sequences and fabulous plot development. Would love to watch again with my gang of friends.Finest movie with Culture and a good thriller
1st thing to say screenplay and direction are too good. From very 1st scene you will be engaged to the story . For every 15-20 mins of story building there will be sudden thrilling scenes which make audiences keep on engaged with the story. The location are too good. Particularly the the shots in snow are too awesome. Nikhil the hero done good job. Anupama is good with in her role. Srinivas Reddy & viva Harsha comedy is decent . Anupam Kher scene is outstanding. Kala Bhirava's music is just ok. And our Main Hero LORD KRISHNA drives the entire story ,just as like driving entire Bharatam.",10/10,Karthikeya 2

The Suspense maintained till end.The negative part is the movie is getting into the actual story in the last half an hour only. I mean only after interval scene only hero is getting into the issue. And it starts moving only in last half an hour.Even though lot of characters were there except Hero and 2-3 characters others were not having much role in the movie including heroine.But the movie was not boring in any instant. That is the biggest plus of this movie. The minute details were missing like how the Policemen killed, why there is no police investigation in the start of the issue etc. This is because the director focussed story only in last half an hour.But overall Good Mystery movie.

evanston_dad,22 August 2022,Have Never Seen Anything Quite Like This,"I have seen a lot of movies in my time, made in a lot of different styles from different genres, from all around the world. I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after ""RRR.""This movie is so much. Its ""much""-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch ""RRR,"" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot ""RRR.""Grade: A+",10/10,RRR
iquine,16 September 2022,Rambo Meshed with Crouching Tiger + Musical....Say Whaaaat?,"I bet you'd never think the mash-up the heavy-handed Rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of Crouching Tiger would work especially, while mixing in several musical numbers. Those who think that would be wrong. This movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness. Even with a 3-hour runtime, I was engrossed. It was a great story with thorough character development. A young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean British government who is controlling the people of Malli, presumably in India. This small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back. But the British government also has an Indian soldier who is equally as skilled; both of which dwarf all other soldiers as you'll see in the spectacular opening scene. As the two skilled fighters clash, will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for. This movie blew me away. I've never seen special effects quite like this before. There were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters. This movie was produced with smart editing, cinematography and choreography. This is a modern must see.",9/10,RRR
matthewssilverhammer,19 August 2022,I wish I could've seen this in a theater,"There is officially ZERO reason to watch Gray Man; THIS is the only (not-so-)semi-subtle homoerotic Netflix action epic we need. A tightrope walk between complete silliness & beautiful sincerity, it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore: insane action, enveloping dialogue, sprawling yet intimate storytelling, elaborate dancing (yep!). Admittedly, the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared, but it's hard to deny the bravura movie-making, daring you to not to have fun.

JeanDeMichaque,17 September 2022,Weirdly spectacular,"When I pushed play, I did not really believe that I would ever watch the whole movie. I just wanted to take a look and bail on it.Well, I was so wrong. This movie is a freaken masterpiece, combines some extraordinary drama, stunning stunts and action, great photography and absolutely beautiful music. Given that this is a Bollywood movie, you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes, an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting won't exactly be Oscar worthy. But none of it made me not enjoy this movie. The time passed by very easily and I ended up having a really great time.The eye candy that is Ram Charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular. That is one ridiculously handsome man, I have to say ;P.

Jeremy_Urquhart,14 July 2022,The best superhero movie in years,"I have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly, because it's not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently. But I can say that for large-scale, big-budget action movies, this is how you do it right. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good. I complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot, and so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters is all I could criticise it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime.",9/10,RRR
owenpont-70803,29 June 2022,Wow........,"This was an incredible film. I never heard of this film until Netflix brought it up. I saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it. I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film. But also the first scene where Ram Charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well. Overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action, comedy, romance, dancing and great storytelling.

It's everything Marvel should have been.This movie is about 2 men, super human, some suspension of belief needs to be had. View it as a super hero movie and it delivers.Plot: It's about 2 men; a hero and the anti hero. One has duty, one has family.It's an action movie, think what Avengers Civil War, Batman vs Superman should have been. In modern American movies, the overuse of CGI makes the movies look cheap. RRR has CGI and some places it does look a little cheap, but for a modern big budget film, it delivers.I have to give it between a 9 and 10. My expectations were low, but the AMAZING actions scenes were filmed very well, the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well done.Highly recommended and a must see.",10/10,RRR
cs_rahul_kumar,25 March 2022,"SS Rajamouli Delivers A Power Packed Action Entertainer Once Again, Made Only For Big Screen !!!","The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fianc√© Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.",10/10,RRR
Quinoa1984,14 April 2022,"probably the most brutally violent PG-13 in a while, plus a dance battle!","Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi ""here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO"" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of ""f the Brits"" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it's totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career! (If only Aamir Khan was here, 5 stars easy).",9/10,RRR

Ajay Devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the Film.The best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effects.The action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excuted.The film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or another.one of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years.",10/10,RRR
justahunch-70549,28 December 2022,A fairytale for warmongers,"There is no doubt that I am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour. There is no questioning this film's technical achievements, which are many. The CGI could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film. This begins with a girl in India being kidnapped by a British governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that, hundreds, if not thousands, die. Throw all logic out the window with this one. Everything in this film is over-the-top. The action, the story, the characters, the violence, even the music. It is beautiful to look at, no doubt, but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly, though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch, but turn off your brain before viewing. The actors put a lot into this, especially the two leads, but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are. Cecille B. DeMille would be envious.

Xstal,28 December 2022,"Rousing, Rampaging, Revelatory...","It strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet, whenever I venture to the studios of India, and its array of languages, innovations and stories, the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive - and quite often spectacular. This is one such film, a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more. Read the reviews of others if you want to know the story, but take it from me, if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire, this is for you. On a par with anything you may have come across in the past, and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you, which it surely will - irresistible.

If you can get past that, and if the violence isn't too much for you, you're in for a treat.There is so much more heart in this movie than anything I've seen for a long while. It's nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action. But more than the great camera work and fantastic music (this movie sounds tremendous), RRR knows how to setup a story. From the very beginning, screentime is being used to setup payoffs later.I can see the violence being an issue for some (though, RRR is not nearly as gory as many films, but it can feel brutal at times--enough that I can't really call this a family film).One of the best films I've seen. Excellent.",9/10,RRR
Prashast_Singh,2 April 2022,"Ravishing, Refreshing, Recommendable.","If Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what S. S. Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film's two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the ""main hero"". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts. This is what cinema exists for, and you don't need to think too much before booking your tickets.",10/10,RRR
jace_the_film_guy,18 September 2022,Larger Than Life,"This might be uncultured, but I usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed. This film completely broke that precedent, as I loved every minute of it. The characters, the action, the dancing, the emotion, everything was larger than life, well-executed and mesmerizing.There were elements in this movie that I have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor. The film is three hours long, but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story. The highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads. The instant rapport and harmony between Ram and Bheem is inspiring, which makes some of the later moments so poignant.As a whole, RRR is over-the-top and big, but also subtle and real. In one moment I would be grinning ear to ear, in the next I was crying, and in the next I was gasping with excitement. Though there were elements I didn't fully understand, I can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and I am anxious to give it another watch.Note: If watching at home, I would recommend watching this film in two or three parts. An intermission is helpful.Note 2: The dancing scene is an all-timer!Note 3: If there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters, I would jump on it in a second!",9/10,RRR
jamesfaustino-82405,29 June 2022,RRR (Ridiculous Riveting Rampage) - a great time!,"This movie is one of the greatest movies I've seen in my life not knowing that Indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one. The action is the best part of this movie, no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action. Even though on some parts I never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and I understood this movie. Some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is. Take notes Hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today.

SAMTHEBESTEST,25 March 2022,A weak writing sparkled by Rajamouli's extraordinary mass elements and Ram Charan & Jr. NTR's larger-than-life characters,"RRR (2022) :
Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with ""Saaho"" and ""Radhe Shyam"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like ""Bahubali : The Conclusion"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what ""mass cinema"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while ""Naacho Naacho,"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. ""Dosti"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and ""Komuram Bheemudo"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear ""Raamam Raaghavam"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed ""Big-Screen Experience"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and ""The Lion King"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*",6/10,RRR
alphadude007,27 March 2022,"VFX treat, but poor storyline, absurd scenes and back to the 80s dialogues","RRR is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means. Rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle. However, the storyline is super weak. Jr NTR's connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire. Ram's motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the British to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare. Lots of sequences in the movie also doesn't make sense, like Jr NTR spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals, transport them to the city, feed them for months and then unleash them on the British army? PLEASE! That was so funny. Then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker? I mean, c'mon Rajamouli. Bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals. Here, the visuals are mediocre, story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe. The actors have done well though. Good chemistry and required machismo. Especially Ram Charan. Hopefully, we get such funds/resources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story.",6/10,RRR

Ajay Devgan's cameo is crucial for the entire storyline.The shiny part is the Jr NTR who plays a Himalayan role, starts as a feather like character, later erupts as a volcano with powerful dialogue delivery and leads to a solidifying rock.The movie is packed with periodic action drama and it almost does fill the Heart. Watch it in IMAX.It will ROAR in many occasions, portrays REVOLT at the right moments and the flag will RISE high when FIRE meets WATER.",9/10,RRR
rosheenkan,25 March 2022,Paisa Vasool Entertainer,"Overall, RRR is probably Rajamouli career best since Bahubali frainchase. While it also became NTR and Ram Charan best film since Magadheera, Rangasthalam and Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava.Music is excellent and direction is great. Sure I think RRR going to set opening record.Definitely a must watch.

Jithindurden,28 March 2022,The best pan Indian film,"The first Rajamouli film I saw was Magadheera. It was a revelation at that time for me that an Indian action film can look this good. The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called ""pan-Indian"" label.",8/10,RRR
krineshshukla,25 March 2022,Rajamauli's Magic is beyond imagination,"This movie takes us to a world with emotional roller coaster ride, patriotism and strong characters. Every character has its own journey and a unique place in the story. I didn't expected VFX to be this good, I mean it was literally stunning to watch it in imax. The visual experience is what was very different from other movies.Overall this is an festival which should be celebrated by everyone.

saru2020,27 March 2022,2nd best Telugu film,"The first day back2back shows, first in Tamil 3D and the consecutive show in Hindi IMAX 3D.I think this is the 2nd best movie from the Telugu industry, just next to the same director's Baahubali 2.Story or plot-wise, there's nothing special but the making is where the film stands out.Visually very engaging, emotionally connecting and there's rarely a scene that is wasted, every single frame has been used.If you don't compare this to the director's previous films, then it'd be an amazing treat for sure and to some extent, it even goes beyond the expectations. Raajamouli is the only director who can do this magic repeatedly.The 2 protagonists' best movie is also this one only, I suppose.Certainly like other films, there are some cons but the pros surpass them easily as it was a refreshing experience watching a nice masala movie after a long time.",10/10,RRR
nathandm-75297,2 December 2022,And the award for the most overrated film of 2022 goes too...,"RRR is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year. It's been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful Tollywood films of all time. My question is why?I'm not familiar at all with Tollywood/Bollywood movies. This was the first one I've seen all the way through. But prior to watching RRR, I was familiar with all of the Bollywood clich√©s and have seen numerous infamous clips on YouTube. They're all very over the top with their presentation and acting, they're all very long, and they all include several dance/musical numbers. But I figured since this was the first Tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie, something that stood out and there really isn't.As I was watching RRR I thought to myself, what if this was an American film and it featured the same story, the same action scenes, and the same length? I would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated, too tonally inconsistent, having bad CGI effects, terrible pacing, underdeveloped romantic subplots, and one-dimensional villains. But I guess since this is a Tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine? Do they add to the charm of this film? I don't know but I'm honestly low-key baffled by the reception that RRR is getting.And I'm also baffled by how this Tollywood film looks just like every other Indian action film that has come out for the past several years. Seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other Indian blockbusters? Feel free to comment because I'd love to know.Here are a few positives I can give this film. There is some nice direction and cinematography, both of the lead actors have good chemistry, some of the action scenes are fun (some are also completely stupid) and sometimes the score is good (and sometimes it's not and very random). Clearly, Indian blockbuster films are just not for me, I'll acknowledge that. Cinema is subjective, so to the people who genuinely love this movie, I'm happy for you, but I still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and I still think it's easily the most overrated film to come out this year, by a lot.",5/10,RRR
sriramthestranger,27 March 2022,Fiction and Fantasy!!,"This is one of the rare Rajamouli films with weakest antagonist after Vikramarkudu. The first half is brilliant and the interval is bang on. The flashback portions are great. But, the climax did not click inspite of fantastic VFX. The movie does not disappoint or lags at any point, and is a good film but not a great one!!

manirsoffl,26 March 2022,6 out of 10 for the technical works,"As a story, there is no such twist and turns and non linear activities like that. A straight and almost one line story with the two biggies made it easier. First half was very good even there was no such flaws of screenplay even the run time was almost more than 90 mins. The problem was the second half of the movie, which badly falls. In tha name of emotions they have poorly executed the screenplay which falls desperately. When it comes the vfx's(except animal effects) everything was visibly attractive. The fire and the water act for the actors worked very well in most of the aspects. The climax fight and the making was actually not satisfying when compared to the first half fight sequences. Overall a technicall strong with flaws in some vfx scenes and with the flawly writted second half, yes we can enjoy it once for the technical brilliance.

Gloria_Green,11 September 2022,Spectacular,"I couldn't stop myself to watch this movie 4 times, I thoroughly enjoyed every scenes and dialogues..It took me to the emotional journey..This movie was a perfect recipe of Action,drama, romance,friendship,patriotic,suspence and thrill and certainly lot of emotions, What i hate about this movie was over all performance of Alia bhatt, she did really bad job, she was not suiting in her character, I wish film maker should have considered some other north actress ,except Alia everything is best -direction,performance, cheography ,cinematography, songs,music...All characters acting was too good...Rajamouli is Superb !The most part I love about that movie is ""Nacho Nacho"" dance performance sync ,what a dot to dot sync between two actors..

olsenry-04499,27 June 2022,"An Indian, live action anime!","I love shows like Cowboy Bebop and Attack on Titan. RRR feels like a live action Indian anime and I love every minute of it! It has some of the best special effects (and at times worst) that I have seen in recent years that isn't tied to Marvel. The choreography of fights and dancing are on par with old Jackie Chan. I'm going to watch RRR again right now! Sequel please!!

sameerlodaya,28 March 2022,It's HUGE,Sameer lodayaThe movie is a HUGE entertainer and it has to be because it's RAJAMOULIthe story is simple of two characters who fights for their purposes but it has presented in a very HUGE way..the entry of two heroes were extravaganza and was beyond imagination..the action was terrific and thumping.. the dance sequence showed In a song were very unique and energetic..the director has kept his brand and delivered more than expectations..both the heroes played their roles according to the directors HUGE brand..the impact of the scenes can be felt as audiences were whistling and howling..your expectations to see a BAAHUBALI makers film will not failThe negative parts are both alia and ajay were kept for Hindi audiences and were given very tiny roles...some scenes were over dramatic and nearly to ham scenes..songs were not up to the mark..at times you will feel the movie is dragged and loses its paceSee it in 3d.,7/10,RRR
wavefaster,25 March 2022,Must watch movie,"Now some audiences going to find logic, bcoz its clear when a good film release some ppl are looking for minus point only.For me it is the second true event film that i liked after 13 Hours. These days everyone doing based on someone life but from my side i have got only 3 hour to entertain myself and I can't regret for what i wasting my time. At this topic i only choose to entertain myself except to watch someone struggle in his/her time. I respect them all but i like to read a book about them not in film.Coming to the topic director did a brilliant job again and prove that he is the legend of indian cinema. Now some ppl will find logic, physic etc... Bcoz they don't know how to entertain themselves. Mostly from hindi audiences, by the way i m also a hindi but i like to praise someone hard work and any good films which entertain me anyway.

tkmce2008,27 March 2022,NTR Jr.'s performance is the only thing that shines in Rajamouli's latest,"After a delay of almost 2 years, SS Rajamouli's latest magnum opus is finally here. A film that needs to be watched on the big screen to be appreciated for the effort gone into making it. Rajamouli knows his audience really well and the thunderous response that RRR is receiving is proof of that.RRR follows a familiar template; one that is common to all action films. Two ripped action heroes burst into the screen ridding on expensive set pieces. They meet and their bromance develops but later they realise that they were meant to stop each other. But a few scenes later, they reconcile and join forces. Apply this to the pre-independence era or 100 years later; the result is the same.Rajamouli is a filmmaker, who lies squarely in between Bhansali & Gowarikar. He goes big with all the grandeur but the plot doesn't match up to all the grandeur. The film stars Ram Charan as Alluri Sitarama Raju (a Telugu revolutionary) & Jr NTR plays Komaram Bheem (revolutionary leader from the Gond tribes). RRR is an entirely fictional story: ""what if the two revolutionaries had met in real life"". I loved NTR's performance the most and the bromance between the leads in the first half. But the second half leaves you disappointed with the usual heavy flying objects and humans. Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Shriya Saran, Olivia Morris, Alison Doody, Rahul Ramakrishna co-starPersonally, I liked RRR more than the two part Bahubali. Bahubali was stretched into two films for no reason & the film was ultimately a big bore. But with RRR, we get a more entertaining and well-paced plot with better performances, high-octane set pieces and foot tapping songs.RRR has a pulsating and highly entertaining first half (more grounded in terms of set pieces as well). But post-interval, it starts to drag to such an extent that even the bow wielding Ram Charan & the bike flipping NTR Jr. Can't save it.",6/10,RRR
shubhamprakashkarad,27 March 2022,First half is good but second half ruined first half's intriguing,"Guys go with low expectations, This is not the movie what Rajamouli capable of... First half was good with some superb action sequences and character introduction but due to lack of story it looks bits and pieces in second half,either we can connect to emotions or to patriotism.. it's too lengthy.. but Hats off to both the actors they nailed their jobs..

rohitreviews,27 March 2022,Below average film saved by Bromance acting,"Movie could have beeen good but it fails many ways in storyThe biggest letdown was the story, second half, and some bits of misalignment of how the story is framed.The story as in, they took both real-life characters and just didn't genuinely tell their life story or freedom struggle but it was more like, ""Oh these two are characters exists who you can check it online, and we used one's character to show saving the tribal girl, and another to avenge the father's death more in the pretext of stockpiling the weapons to wage war against brits"" that's it.This can't be called a good story. I would give it 1 or 2 just for the story, not even 7. I mean after the first attack at the party, the Brit leader could have easily shot the girl to settle things. But he goes on punishing the Bheema who was caught, which seems illogical if you think of it. Brits would have killed both girl and him back then. They often just want to kill as many people without any mercy, which is a fact. This didn't align with the genuine story. Think of Sardar Uddham, they showed they were merciless and hardly cared about kids or anyone if they wanted to shoot, they just did it. Just like Nazis. So it kind of didn't give needed liking from the start.Second half: The issue was, there is no setup of who Ajay was in the first place or his wife or those village army people he was training, and the one who was often seen with Ram to help him with his goals to get near weapons. I mean when they introduce Ram's character, they show him fighting with so many people to get one guy. The ferocity in which it's shown to fight all there just to get that guy, he could have simply killed the brits killed as they were short numbered and got the whole people's support charging them up to revolt and seeking their help to hide his identity and later can get the weapons. Why I'm saying this is, he does the same to Bheem and that time Bhim sings and makes every people raked up. It's still the same, isn't it?And this makes Ram believe in Bheem's ability to lead as he could be more force, while he had a similar opportunity at the start freely given. Both these two situations don't equate to the necessary logic of fighting against brits when brits were so cornered.. And both times Brit nowhere had any stronger points to create havoc and the only thing they held was the girl, whom they could have easily killed in reality.Framing of the story: I felt they should have started with Ajay being the older guy with young son Ram both fighting and it would have helped the second half making more thrilling effect.Overall it's a decent movie, won't say good or best, but just a one-time popcorn masala watch. Even Alia, Shreya, Ajay, and Tamil actor were so underutilized. Their existence too was pointless in a way. It could have been a best-made film if they genuinely tried to tell the real-life story of the characters even if wanted to go over the top sure like Sai Ra Narasimha Reddy's style.But what stood out and truly helped the movie was the performance of both Jnr NTR and Ramcharan, their bromance is the only thing which saved the movie-watching experience, I feel. It's not the story, it's their acting, a few good visuals. That's it.",4/10,RRR
Movi3DO,30 May 2022,Very fun,"I usually don't dig Bollywood movies that were too over-the-top, which is like most Bollywood movies. However, I gotta give it to RRR for making it actually fun and exciting.Horrendous CGI aside, the dance scenes were super dope, especially that dance battle. Me and my boy actually wanted to give the dance a try. It won't be that good, but the point is that the actors were damn entertaining and amazing executing those moves.The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining.The story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle part. I was bored for a good chunk, waiting for more action scenes. The backstories didn't really add much to the present plot, even though they provided some more fun action. And of course, I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters, as I just wanted this movie to be all about the over-the-top action.Overall, it's a highly entertaining movie that I had a great time even though there's still many problems with it. 7.5/10.",7/10,RRR

RC & NTR intro, their friendship are heart melting. I guess not even Hollywood or anyone can design this kind of intervel episode except SSR. Ajay episode is good. The scenes with Alia and NTR in pre climax make you roll out tears and the RC transformation to Alluri getup makes you clap in the theater. Wonderful experience. Movie wise it's greater than bahubali. Had chances to cross bahubali collection. 3d is also too good. Already watched 2 times 2d and 3d.

winak,16 April 2022,Exaggerated Fairy tale !!!,"As Indians we do love our British bashing patriotic movies, but this one so over the top you'd think you time traveled into an 80s movie. This is catered towards the simple minded audiences. How Rajamouli managed to rope in reputed Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson is beyond me. As for Ajay Devgun, looks like the director grabbed him right off the sets of Tanhaji but he did have a decent cameo; careful don't blink you might miss Alia in the movie. Liberal use of cheap CGI, in fact I have seen better CGI in made for TV movies. The whole premise of this 3 hour movie unravels around the kidnapping of a tribal child which I found weak definitely not in the league of Bahubali by a long shot. If you're still curious what all the fuss is about, have a look. If you want to save your money, I suggest waiting till it shows up on your TV.",4/10,RRR
Raz0R5,25 March 2022,Enjoyable action experience with 2 characters who have superpowers (literally),"First of all really good, mature acting by NTR jr. And Ram Charan. The scenes they are together, the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie.The production value made it very enjoyable to watch. The close up shots, the well made CGI all took this movie up some notches.Though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti British fetish. The commercial elements was seen everywhere but I guess that was intentional for mass audiences.It was great to experience it in 3D. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance.

Rajamouli has created yet another Landmark Cinema in Indian Film History, taking two real life revolutionaries and designing a fictional story with overarching themes of Friendship & Patriotism. Right from the get go, your jaw is left hanging with Unbelievably choreographed Action Scenes and till the end those just keep on coming. SSR knows how to extract genuine emotion from the story and actors, and this time also he excels. The brotherhood between Jr NTR & Ram Charan is something special, with both getting plenty of moments to shine. They have devoted their souls for this film. Incredible Cinematography & Shot selection by Senthil Kumar. MM Keeravani's BGM makes your hairs stand up And surges you with energy. 3 hours fly by as no scene feels redundant. The 3D & VFX is surprisingly good except a few lapses. Do watch this in a 3D theater with great sound, otherwise you will miss an unimaginable experience.

thejdrage,11 June 2022,Holy Cow - The long and the short of it,"This is a long movie - 3 hours. And it's so many things rolled into one!I have never seen an Indian produced movie, and was not disappointed. It had absolutely everything in it, except a kitchen sink. Music, dancing, critters (CGI so they weren't hurt nor did they consume any of the extras), good guys, bad guys, the list goes on and on for 3 hours. I DO wish there had been more dancing, but I also understand that's not what this was about.It is a full service movie. It has shoot outs galore, so love happening. There's SO much happening, I can't touch on it all without being here for 3 hours. Let's just say that if you haven't seen and Indian movie before - give this one a go.

suprabhattacharya,5 April 2022,A masterfully made epic,"An extravagantly epic project in Indian cinema can only be done by a few and Rajamouli comfortably tops the list. Rajamouli knows to infuse cinematic brilliance amidst his huge larger-than-life, over-the-top storytelling. The visual glamour which he presents in his films is thoroughly satisfying and pleasing to watch.RRR is a film dipped in extreme tropes of commercialism, and still, there is a sense of realism in the characters and the events he presents throughout the film. The characters in the film are driven by typical human desires, what I mean to say you could realize every person's motive behind their actions which doesn't seem over the top rather it's how they execute their motives to achieve them is.The action set pieces are constructed extremely well, though that doesn't deny the fact that they are not logical, still, the build-up of every action sequence is infused with adrenaline rush and jaw-dropping visual splendor. The visual mastery of Rajamouli is instrumental in the epic sequences.Amidst all the visual extravaganza, there lies a simple storyline that is well balanced in three parallel screenplays. The fact that the story moves conventionally, not taking any absurd twists and turns to invoke a shock works because the nature of the film is thoroughly simplistic.The characters of Ram Charan and NTR mix well to form an exciting bromance story to screen. Both of them are fueled by opposite motivations, and that contrast adds more to their chemistry. NTR and Ram Charan of them were splendid in their roles and Rajamouli's script seems tailor-made for them.The film surely loses points in the comic scenes and takes down the watching experience a bit, but that doesn't last very long. The third act loses integrity and believability, although the visual brilliance has not left the film not for a single moment there too.The antagonists are strictly one-dimensional, though adding layers to their character was not necessary. The melodrama Rajamouli invokes in the film sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.The scenes of both the introductions of NTR and Ram charan were splendidly constructed and executed, both scenes deserve special mention.In an epic film of the highest proportions, Rajamouli delivers what he is expected. The indelible cinematic quality of a mass film is quite rare to achieve and Rajamouli has done that quite well.",8/10,RRR
sanvarma-02243,27 March 2022,No comparison to Bahubali!,"When you are watching the movie and feel when will it end... u know its more hype than content... weak story line... cinematography is good, Ram Charan and JR NTR both good but weak script does not help the cause... overall 5/10!",5/10,RRR
rehman-38960,26 March 2022,Blockbuster Written All over it..!!!,"RRR is a Magnum opus Spectacular visually movie. It's an all n out total Paisa vasool movie. SS Rajamouli is a Craftsman in every scene. JR NTR and Ramcharan has Done there parts exceptionally well. Alai and Ajay as an Extended Cameo did well. Music and Background Score gives you Goosebumps. Overall it's a Blockbusters Written All over it.

WorldMovie99,31 March 2022,What happened to S.S Rajamouli ? 9.1 ??,"I saw it today with my classmates. I will say it was very disappointing. I was unable to sit within one and half hour. But for the sake of my friends I saw it, for almost three hours. It was ungripping and draggy.There is a huge amount of unrealistic scenes esp the action ones. The sentimental scenes were totally unappealing. The script was good , also had a good storyline. But it missed the real ground, presented with significant flaws. The movie had a potential but didn't got lighten up in that way. Very predictable as an anti british movie. Felt like the southern frustration against Britons are still seeking grudges and will end in their bloodshed. Lots of mindless actions makes it unable to watch.S. S Rajamouli is a good director. Bahubali franchise proves that. But what happened here ? I m shocked. Literally the climax turned Bahubaali. I mean WTH. I was laughing in the climax with my friends. And believe me the climax scenes were the gore ones. For the effort to make the movie I would give a 2/10.",2/10,RRR
prasanna-nagaraja,26 March 2022,"Why did even watch this movie!!! You, please don't.","Is this the kind of movie we expect to see?The story is supposed to be something about pre-independence struggle.There is no storyline and all about mass and heroism. Not related to anything that happened in reality.The movie sends a wrong message and I hate to see people giving 10/10 rating. Something is really wrong with us.

jeromesgabilo,27 December 2022,A MODERN INDIAN CLASSIC,"Very rarely do I watch an Indian film and this one really blew me away! A tale of two friends from different backgrounds in colonial India was such a perfect backdrop for the marvelous storytelling of this epic drama. The cinematography was vibrant and dynamic, from simple dialogues to its entertaining dance scenes. This alone should have gotten an international acclaim from critics. The two actors' performances was an equally integral part of the film. The emotion they poured into their roles were very inspiring to the rest of the global movie industry. The music and score were impressive as well. India was made a more interesting country because of this movie.

Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,14 June 2022,RRR Explodes Off the Screen,"Hey, Streamers! Word of mouth is a powerful tool in marketing a movie. I have been hearing about this epic, 3-hour action flick from India for the past few months. I heard that it was a spectacle full of high octane action sequences, musical performances and more that had to be seen to be believed. While I couldn't catch this one in the theater, Netflix has added RRR to its service. Here's how it goes.Yes, RRR is an epic, action movie about two men on a collision course with the British Empire in India. There is Bheem, who sets out to rescue Malli, a young girl from his tribe who was kidnapped by the British governor and his wicked wife. Then, there is Rama, an Indian police officer working for the British army. Bheem is fierce and ruthless, cunning and singularly focused on his goal to save Malli. Rama is equally fierce and ruthless and set on protecting the British government. As Bheem and Rama meet and become unlikely friends, secrets and hidden agendas lead to more than they both bargained for in their relationship and lead to the simmering revolutions against the British Empire.Despite its 3-hour run time, RRR is relentless. There are some lulls when the movie is setting up its plot, but it doesn't dwell much in exposition. Believe me, you may need a moment to breathe in between these action sequences. The film moves from action sequence to musical number and back. There are crazy visual effects and boundless energy coming from the screen through the camera movements and the actors.Actually, words cannot explain what this movie is really like. You just have to see it to believe it.RRR is a must-see movie. Sure, it's long, but don't let the runtime deter you. There is enough energy and action to fill the screen from beginning to end. It is surprising and worth the time spent. Grab a big box of popcorn and settle in for butt kicking and dancing and action in RRR.",8/10,RRR
nadkarnisumeet,26 March 2022,Vintage Bollywood!,"RRR review :The one movie which came in my mind after watching Rajamouli's three hour plus extravaganza is the late Manmohan Desai's Mard (1985). Like Desai's last hit, RRR is all about fighting against British who are depicted here as blood sucking vampires, no less! In fact, one British General's wife demands more blood and gore as she witnesses the public flogging of a lead actor. Oofff!!By the way, the British are not just mere murderers but also randomly pick up innocent children from their village for a pound or two. The entire three hour screenplay is dedicated to bringing this child back from their evil clutches. Woah!!Unlike his previous Bahubali (2015), Rajamouli has chosen a flimsy plot this time and though he infuses his trademark dazzle and grandeur, the end result is nowhere close to his erstwhile blockbuster. Yup, we get many breathtaking visuals and superbly choreographed action setpieces but RRR just doesn't hold on the whole. In one scene, we see NTR Jr. Holding a vintage motorcycle and then throwing it like a frisbee on his opponent. Oh, and we blame poor John Abraham in Bollywood for doing the same!!Of the cast, Junior NTR and Ram Charan are both brilliant and their onscreen camaraderie reminded me of Dharam-Jeetendra in Desai's another hit Dharam Veer (1977). Thats the thing with RRR...it makes you nostalgic of all those Bollywood excesses of yore. The times when we applauded the hero bashing up a few thousands single handedly (Ram Charan's intro for example) or taming a tiger with his bare hands (NTR's great grand entry). Growwlll! This is a typical vintage masala flick presented on a spectacular scale in 3D with some four hundred crores worth of investment. Offo!!Not that I am against all yesteryear masala entertainers but in today's world, a four hundred crores magnum opus which can only afford to bring back nostalgia of those classic entertainers then made with significant budget constraints cannot be wholeheartedly appreciated. Please!!Bollywood stars Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt appear in cameos just to make the film saleable in the Hindi belt. Devgn gets two scenes. Alia gets three. There is zero value add from these two!! The British actors are so caricaturish that perhaps, even animation would work fine in place of humans; I kid you not!!On the positive, the production values are top notch, the VFX is reasonably impressive (first hour specially) and the climactic transformation of Ram Charan in to Lord Ram's avatar is an interesting twist which drew loud whistles in the half empty Paradise Cinema, Mahim I visited first day first show. Sadly, the rest of the movie was all deja vu!!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",6/10,RRR
MaverickV,31 March 2022,Overhyped Masala film!,"Again, another masala movie for the corrupt masses...not much in terms of storyline or drama. Mindless and over-the-top action sequences which are only possible in Indian cinema, and where the movie can also be a blockbuster from market viewpoint!!!Nothing much here, dont waste your time.

KunvarAishwary,25 March 2022,A Mass Entertainer,"Either portray the leads to have super human abilities and call them super heroes, or give them humanly strength and portray them only as powerful humans, but you can't and shouldn't portray super humans as normal beings and that too simultaneously. It is a mass entertainer, where heroes can do anything and no one and nothing can hurt them. The heroes can fight a mob of 1000s, can fight lions and tigers, can lift, throw and use a motorcycle with a hand, can get buffed up with one meal a week, can break open a complete hard-iron jail cell, and so on. It is another physics defying movie portraying humans as God (literally too).First half was still 6/10, but second was just a plain mob pleaser. Continuous fight sequels with dragged storyline.

Two men against the world, still victorious.Stretched, too violent and loud, weak plot, physics defying, logic less mass entertainer.",4/10,RRR
pradyumnathegenius,28 March 2022,Over rated film,"Purely illogical. Action scenes are like superman scenes. Can't understand why people are giving it good rating. One of the worst story . Heard tht it's a dream project . I think thts why director made this so unreal. Expected a lot. Still it's making a good business. Strange. Only thing good in this movie is acting. And the direction n story line very poor.

jaredkjacoby,24 September 2022,An Action Movie Epic,"When British governor Scott Buxton kidnaps a young girl from her tribe, the guardian of the tribe, Komaran Bheem vows to rescue the girl from her captives. Bheem enters the British Raj, the colonization of an Indian subcontinent by the British to get in Buxton's stronghold and rescue the girl. Aware of Bheem's presence, Buxton offers a special reward for the officer who brings him in. A. Ram Raju, an Indian officer with a lot of strength and talent, volunteers for the job and is instructed to bring him in alive. In a turn of events, they meet each other and not knowing each other's true identities, they end up becoming best friends after rescuing a child from a falling train on fire.The best way to describe this movie is that RRR is an action movie epic. This movie is one of the most glorious pieces of entertainment I have seen in years despite its three-hour runtime. There is not a single minute in this movie that is boring. There is always something crazy happening in the story whether it is a crazy action scene, a fun moment in the bromance, a comedic scene, a dramatic scene or even a lively musical number. RRR is a complete package.First of all, I adore the two protagonists, Bheem and Raju. Both of them are awesome in their characterization and in skills. Bheem is a kindhearted man who wants to rescue Malli and take down the evil British Empire. Despite this, he never targets anyone innocent. He does a great job disguising himself and he overall incredibly likable and endearing, especially with his interactions with Jenny. Raju on the other hand is one of my favorite characters in a movie this year. He fights a whole mob with his a blunt weapon, he encourages his friend in a dance off, he has the best arc in the movie and he has an interesting backstory. Raju is a fantastic character to the point where I actively rooted for his survival throughout the film. The bromance between Bheem and Raju is wonderful as well. They are so wholesome together, you forget that they have opposite goals while you see them hang out. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan share some of the best chemistry I have seen in years. They act like best friends throughout the movie. The two leads make this movie a delight to watch.As for the rest of the characters, the British villains are quite despicable with Buxton and his wife being some of the most despicable people of the year. They are complex villains, but you want to see them go down in flames. Jenny is an interesting character. I thought she would be a twist villain who is only there to give the British Empire a good public face. Turns out, she is not really bad, just with bad people. I'm glad she ended up not being a villain, but I kind of wish she would have been a bigger character by the end. That is probably my only complaint in the entire film.The script is fantastic as well. The story engaged me from beginning to end between Raju's past, the friendship between Pheem and Raju, the conflict when they reveal themselves to each other and the adventure of the film. A great action movie has a great story and this movie is proof of that. It takes full advantage of its runtime to develop these characters and flesh out the themes and world of the movie. The tone is a perfect balance between lighthearted cheesiness and touching dark moments. When the movie gets cheesy, it is the fun cheese as this movie is hilarious with its humor and sequences. However, it pulls of its emotional moments well, including a torture scene that reminded me of Braveheart in some ways. The script packs a lot in one movie, but it delivers big time.The spectacle in this movie is out of this world. It puts many American blockbuster films to shame. This movie has at least three of my favorite set pieces of the year. The first infiltration of the stronghold, the rescue of the child at the train wreck and the insane climactic battle are all standout set pieces. Each one of them are not only a joy to watch, but they are creative in the way the stunts are performed and how the bad guys are taken out. The fights also show how Bheem represents water and how Raju represents fire, especially the one-on-one fight between the two. There is not a single action scene in this movie that is boring to watch. It is all so much fun. The sets and costumes are gorgeous as well. The cinematography is stunning as there are several jaw dropping shots and a couple solid takes. The only minor bad thing about the visuals are that some of CGI on the animals are not that great, but only when there is so much going on. The animals still look believable. I didn't question it at all except for maybe one or two scenes. The visuals in this movie are spectacular.Also, this movie has an awesome soundtrack. The musical score and main theme are great and fun to listen too, but this movie has some surprisingly robust musical numbers. The dance choreography is on point and so much fun to watch. It seems like every single person had a blast with this film.RRR is about as close to perfect as an action movie can get. This action epic proves that a good movie is never too long. Despite being three hours long, I did not once check my phone to see what time it was. This movie makes me want to watch more Bollywood films. I feel like I am missing out. This movie brought me so much joy that I almost want to watch again right after the first time. This movie is smart, creative, funny, heartwarming and bonkers in the best possible way. My only regret is that I did not see this movie when it was first released in theaters. For now, I will seek this film out on Blu-Ray as soon as I can.",10/10,RRR
By_Ranjith,24 June 2022,"+(5/10) Why is everyone shouting, crying or flying in this film? When will it end?!","RRR is a patriotic period film that is 'set' up in the pre-independence era where we see two superficial characters holding guns up against one another before turning towards the common enemy.A remarkable cast and an amazing crew did kindle curiosity but didn't obey reality. As a result, other than Alia Bhatt's performance, we have to endure gravity defying logics, awfully crafted CGI, increasingly violent BGM and a fresh dose of cliched drama.If Mr. Rajamouli puts equal efforts on story telling and technical finesse, we may get a film that surpasses Bahubali's records but for now, we have got only RRR.

iamkingoffical,25 March 2022,Not so good,"RRR is not even closer to bahubali, It's overhyped, at a point i feel it have too much unrealistic action and no logic. When we watch bahubali 2 first time, It can't get over from my head for 1 week... Bahubali is a godlike hero and fantasy movie and every action he do looks really even you see it many times, But bheem and ram are just normal human beings, showing them as super humans looks very unrealistic. First half is boring, When bheem meet maari at scott home at jail there is no emotion than i can feel, it's look like they are acting, Slightly comedy in some scene, In last scene ram is injured his legs and next scene he is running and jumping, It's good to watch one time but when watch again you notice many things and that's making feel worse.",3/10,RRR
lalithmailipilli,29 March 2022,Overhyped,"To be honest I didn't like the movie at all. 3 hrs and 6 min of runtime was unnecessary plus additional 45 minutes of advertisements made it more of a headache. Except for the performances of Ram Charan and Jr. NTR, the visuals and the action scenes, the film had nothing else to show.I wasn't a fan of Ram Charan's acting but he just nailed it in this movie. He was beyond expectations. Jr. NTR was as usual outstanding. Alia Bhatt, Shreya Sharan, Ajay Devgan had guest appearances. Samuthirakani is under-utilized for the whole movie. All these should have been given more screen on time because they had an important role in the movie.I give 3 stars, 1 for Ram Charan, 1 for Jr. NTR, 1 for the hardwork everyone put.

kongecssn,4 April 2022,Worst film in my life,"IDK,what rajamouli did for 4 years and resources. This is the worst movie in my life. I was extremely hyped by promotions and millions of fake reviews. Since,this movie lacks story then we should get attached to emotions driven in movie. It utterly failed me to connect the emotions. A very well known story and hypocritical movie.

akhil027,29 March 2022,Not Bad,"That's all it is. The script is not strong enough. The writing couldn't make me feel for any one of the characters. Ram Charan did a really good job. Jr NTR's performance fell out of control. Talents like Samudrakani and Aliya were underutilized. MM Keeravani's score and songs were not as good as expected.Ram Charan's intro was awesome. Also, the scene with so many animals was awesome. Felt the Rajamouli effect during these scenes. Other than that, I didn't find anything impressive in the movie.

Grey_rainbow,25 March 2022,"Not bad, but not remotely as good as the hype","The hype for this movie was unreal. But it ended up being just ok-ish, at best. If you dont know anything about the actors playing the heroes in the movie, like me, you will get bored at many points. This movie could be a great treat for mad fans of those celebrities, but the same doesn't hold for non-Telugu audience.Coming to the making, the thing that bothered me the most was CGI. For the budget, I was expecting much better CGI than Bahubali, but it was just as bad. BB was first such big movie, so the poor CGI was ignored by most. But here, the makers have no excuse as they have spent a ton of money and it has been nearly 6-7 years since BB, so technology has advanced as well. Even a simple fort, crowds, or some bird-view shots of the ground look cheesy. Possibly, the makers spent all the money on marketing and forgot about the product.Overall, it's an average movie. Dont buy the hype, keep your expectations low, and you wont be disappointed.",6/10,RRR

kranthireddyg,26 March 2022,RAJAMOULI HITS BULLSEYE AGAIN!!!,Stellar performances from NTR. Jr and Ram Charan.Rajamouli is synonym for perfect filmmaking with absolute precision so lovingly called as 'jakkanna'.This movie has all typical mouli signature mark moves.Outstanding performances from cast.Jaw dropping action sequences.Top notch visual effects.Keeravani blend of class and mass mixed with melodious and emotional touch music worked very well just like all Rajamouli movies does.He absolutely brings best in every cast and crew he works with.He knows how to convey emotional scenes on screen in a way that hits right chords of audience.Interval scene is more powerful than any other scenes from movie.But this movie just falls short of one thing.After completing every Rajamouli movie we are left with a satisfactory feeling while we leave screen.But after completing this movie there is a vaccum left in audience.It maybe because climax is not as powerful as interval or too much emphasis on either of one protagonist or anything that makes us feel there's something that leaves us thinking that something should be done other way around.Except that this movie is like any other Rajamouli movies a masterpiece.,9/10,RRR
viveck_thakur,3 December 2022,Can't be right.,"How can so many people misread one movie so badly or am I missing something? If this movies receive so much appreciation India should have had multiple Academy wins but that is not the case for two reasons. One, Indian movies are acquired taste and two 80% of Indian movies are not worth it anything, let alone international recognition, same like everywhere else. But the two factors combined really puts largest movie producing country in the world behind all the other countries.Coming back to RRR, everything in this movie is way over the top and two protagonist are mightier than superheroes. Even Captain America will give in if barely given food for two weeks but our hero barely loses a muscle and he is not just hungry but wounded as well. Other protagonist doesn't even squeeze his eyebrows when whipped by barbed whip and doesn't flinch releasing wild animals in a party when there can be women and children present. The emotions are so basic and solution so convenient. Most Englishmen seen in the movie do not have a shred of decency and are de facto villains. Movie that is so colorful all the characters are either black or white. Compared to villains in this movie, Thanos will be a saint and Avengers will be ashamed of themselves for killing him.To sum it up, it is beyond me that this movie is getting so much recognition. This can't be happening. It can't be right.",5/10,RRR

The music and choreography are phenomenal too.The two main characters strength and agility is so impressive and their skill in portraying a huge range of emotions just blew me away. Each scene must have taken ages to produce. I'm running out of superlatives here as this movie is beyond doubt the best I've seen in a long time.

Fella_shibby,23 September 2022,"One helluva crazy action packed entertainer. Watch out for the tigers, stags, wolves, etc going berserk.","I saw this last night (22/09/22) on Netflix n this is my first review on IMDb aft a sabbatical break of 3 months.This one is action packed n very very entertaining.Of course one gotta leave the brains at home n forget that gravity exists.I enjoyed the animals attack scene n the tiger capturing scene.Tigers, wolves, stags, etc running helter skelter n tearing people makes Days Of Animals look like kindergarten.I enjoyed the Nacho Nacho song so much that i wanna learn the steps by joining a dance class.The bike scene towards the end, the gun shootings via sitting on partner's shoulder n the gravity defying jumpings, all this is totally amazeballs.The heroes in this movie possess superhuman powers n totally immortal n the villains are cruel, evil n totally despicable.",9/10,RRR

ghythaljml,11 October 2022,"enjoyable and fun, nothing more, nothing less","The work may be very cheerful, and this is what we miss in the past years. I think everyone who will see it, you should throw your cinematic background as if you did not know anything about it. If you do not do that, you will not like the movie.For example, some will see CGI as ugly and unforgivable, and others will see it as funny.There is one very positive thing to talk about which is the way of displaying friendship that you can feel and empathize with.But in general, you should never take the work seriously, and if you are, you have a real problem because we need this dose of enjoyment every once in a while, but not always because it lacks the real cinematic factors.

maitreyatamrakar,25 March 2022,If you want an honest review read this.,"There is nothing new in this Movie, if it is given a score it would be 2/10. 2 marks for good visual effects.Spoiler Alert-:The same old method (recipe) has been used to make it. Hero's promise (to heroine or father), Hindu-Muslim brother-brother (unity), fight for freedom from the British, save the innocent. After all these things, to add more flavor to it, showing the hero as a superhuman (without telling his powers, at least add one myth that how he has so much power), the twist of South (Tollywood) (turning the whole story up side down), too much VFX (Low quality visual effects) No scene is without VFX and loud sound is used to make it impressive. It has a lot of slow motion, (too much) if slow motion is removed then the Movie run time will be reduced by at least 30 minutes. So if you are going to watch RRR, don't go. This is the same old Tollywood movie which could have been made in 50 crores but these people have made it for 400 crores by investing pointless money.",2/10,RRR
legobuilderpro,7 November 2022,Friendship against the British,"This movie was fascinating. I do not usually watch movies like this, but I thought this was cool that the country of India made this movie because of how big in scale this movie is.The acting was great, and the two main characters were nice to see together. The two main characters have a nice friendship with each other and you like having them together doing things like dance battles or going up against the British together.The action scenes in the movie are nicely choreographed and they look like cooking, even though they can defy physics the way it is shot makes it look real. The dramatic scenes are effective, and you can feel the pain the characters go through throughout the movie.There are dance battles and/or only regular dance numbers that are well done, you can admire the dance choreography because of how fast they move to the music. The British in the movie is clearly shown as evil and brutal when going up against people from India, I thought this was a way for us to root for the main characters but also know what it was like being attacked by them.RRR (2022) is a movie I highly recommend that has great action, dance numbers, choreography, acting, and good music. You must find the right time to watch it because it is 3 hours and 7 minutes long, but it is worth your time.",8/10,RRR
Moviecritic200432,27 March 2022,Visuals are decent....that's about it,"So some context to what I'm about to say, I watched this movies in the theater on the second day it released, there is some talks about cutting the movie and changing some things so if they do I would change my review, but I can guarantee not by a lot. Lets go in order as there is a lot to cover in this 3 hour film. First lets start which the fact that its 3 hours long, as a surprise to when I did my research of this film I found out that it was going to be nearly 4 hours long originally, now I will go over why cutting the movies down to 3 hours was a good move later but that's just a piece of information it would be good to know. Lets begin with the storyline, to say in simple words its boring, usually in these types of movies there is some sort of twist or turn that keeps things interesting, but not this one. The story is extremely linear and there is a good chance you could predict the whole movies by watching the first 30 minutes. Not to mention most the story flashbacks and the characters motives are revealed in the first half of the movie ,this means there was no reason to even watch the second half because we know what happened already. This is something that I think is pretty dumb because if you are going to make a 3 hour long movie you need to keep the audience engaged and revealing most the stuff in the first half is doing the exact opposite of that. If we are looking at the general storyline its pretty bland and the action mostly saves the large amount of loopholes and illogical scenes. Next lets talk characters, this was a pretty big mess. So just by watching the movies its obvious that Ram Charan's character had a lot more effort put into it than Jr NTRs character. This is pretty obvious when they go into their flashbacks and motives, also when they are in emotional scenes. Ram Charan seemed more motivated to his cause than Jr NTR seemed to his. Over all Jr NTRs character could have used some work. On a side note there were character like Alia Bhatt and Samurthrakani who posed no significance and were practically useless in this movies, I would have rather preferred that there were less significant actors in their roles because they barely got screen time and it was disappointing to the select audience that are fans and had come to watch the movies for them. Ok now lets talk about the logic and loopholes. Now I can't go over all of them because I would be here all day. Now getting past the Physical logicality of this movies has to be done because in pretty much every scenes there is no regard to the physical world of things and that is evident when he jump across 3 barrels in the first scene. Lets talk storyline logic, so one thing that is really stupid is that there is no regard to the period language and attitude. The British speak modern day English and it really takes away the whole period era vibes. Also this is more of a nitpick but the uniforms and ranks of the officer are incorrect and this shows that there wasn't much effort put into these parts. Now I'm only going to go over one more loophole as there is simply too many. So in Ram's flashback scene it is shows that the British was sent by the government to arrest the militia leader and break the militia up, a bunch of people died and the rest escaped, then later in the movies it is shown that the British government sent a letter to Seetha who is part of the still active militia, now if they knew her address why didn't they just send people to go arrest them and detain them, they are still a active militia and the British government already tried once to capture them and failed so wouldn't they try to capture them again if they knew where they were. So those are the main problems, some side issues include the fact that the 2 main characters basically killed a bunch of innocent people, now some of the British soldiers were bad people but not all of them, in the scenes where they kill multiple soldiers they can't all be bad people ,they are just fighting for their country. Now the main characters get away with this and they feel no guilt at all as if they are taking more lives of the innocent than saving. There is more to talk about and I may extend my review later but in the conclusion you should still go watch this movies in the theaters because the movies was originally said to release in 2020 and the director and crew have gone through a lot to produce this movie after jumping through lots of hurdles, its evident that SS Rajamouli put passion in to this and that is always appreciated, so turn off your brain and watch the movie and you will enjoy it.",6/10,RRR
nrpalnz,26 March 2022,One side is baseless,"#RRR is a mere collection of continuous action sequences shared between 2 lead roles. While you enjoy magnanimity of the scenes and emotions once coming back to home you left with a big question that what you watched is a compromise in the name of Rajamouli.Bheem in this movie is totally a baseless character that doest serve any purpose than playing a sidekick. NTR*s talent has been wasted on an unjustified role who challenges the British kingdom for a weak reason where he doesn't seem to have any deeper connection. Justifying his mission save the girl is far from reality. #poorntr.

jaaffersadiq-500-910475,27 March 2022,Felt looted after finding it out to be such a mediocre film,"Expectation Kills. Right from the beginning, RRR was being promoted/aggressively marketed to be a PRIDE OF INDIAN CINEMA. But after watching it on its opening day, it was totally the opposite of what was marketed. Rajamouli has solely made this film to promote two star kids. Let's not get ahead of ourselves by terming RRR movie as Pride of Indian Cinema or on par with Hollywood movies. Nothing new achieved in this one apart from the wide release. Our people have saw Hollywood movies... So lets get there and then talk abt it.Mr. Rajamouli Simply felt looted after watching the movie with so much expectation and buzz created. Stop it. Get back to the drawing board and give us some well deserved Sci-Fi movies with such humungous budgets or else STFU. We would be laughed on for self loathing after delivering this.

brentsbulletinboard,3 January 2023,I Needed a Good Laugh When I Watched This,"The Bollywood style of filmmaking has, arguably, become a distinct genre all its own, characterized by long, visually dazzling movies filled with action sequences on steroids, hyper-energized music video segments (regardless if relevant to the story), and glamorously designed costumes, hair and makeup. It's definitely an acquired taste and eminently commercial, but it's not exactly something one could characterize as epic, groundbreaking cinema. Which is why I'm stunned by all of the attention and awards season buzz that's being showered on this over-the-top offering, one that's fairly typical of releases in this genre. In this hypothetical ""what if"" tale about a fictitious meeting between a pair of Indian freedom fighters who struggled against brutal British colonial rule (and who never met in real life), writer-director S. S. Rajamouli takes viewers on a whirlwind action-adventure saga that's preposterous, predictable, clich√©d, at times juvenile, and, above all, exhausting by the time one reaches the end of its 3+-hour runtime. The trite dialogue, corny narrative, cheesy CGI effects (particularly the film's wild animals) and monodimensional characters (most notably the big bad Brits who come across more like caricatures than villains) are all laughable, almost as much as the film's fight sequences, which play like scenes from the ""John Wick"" and ""Matrix"" franchises with a dash of martial arts flicks thrown in for good measure. In fact, were it not for the seemingly incessant runtime, this might qualify as one of those good ""bad"" offerings for a group movie night, though the film becomes tiresome about an hour in and can't adequately sustain that sense of high camp for more than 180 minutes. In its defense, the picture's choreography in the musical sequences is commendable (if at times it's like watching a protracted aerobics class), and the costumes, art direction and set design are all noteworthy (save, of course, for a shattered marble railing in one scene that looks like the Styrofoam from which it appears to have been made). Given all of the foregoing, however, I'm truly perplexed why this release has been singled out from the other films in this genre as the beneficiary of such generous awards season recognition, perhaps other than the fact that it has been a huge box office hit worldwide, which may well have something to do with that. But is that milestone enough to drive the ample bestowing of such accolades? Remember, popcorn may qualify as a great snack, but it certainly does not a meal make.",3/10,RRR
diwakar-venkata,26 March 2022,Lags emotional connect,"Although the movie has excellent technical brilliance and some scenes that are shot lavishly, overall it's missing the soul. None of the characters create impact and they come and go. Even the antagonist is weak. He repeats the same dialogue again and again. Ajay Devgan and Alia are wasted big time. Story is paper thin and doesn't deserve any of this lavishness.

Datrebor,11 October 2022,I can't believe just how great this movie is.,"I don't know why maybe it the music or the dancing but for some reason I really love watching it. I really to be able to swing a motorcycle like he did is really unbelievable. It like Jet Lee in The One where he killed every one oh him in alternate dimensions. Thus making even stronger for each person he kills. They are like bigger than live, like a supernatural being. If I was think that any part of it was real it makes my blood boil with hatred for the very for the British in the way they were treated, not even worth the cost of a bullet. I just loved how they used a flaming motorcycle to blow the place and killed the very evil lady that wanted to see him bleed a pool of blood at his feet. I was never so glad they got just what they deserved. It actually reminds me of how Russia is trying to control Ukraine. Just how Ukraine are fighting for their very freedom itself. I have litterly watched several times and I have enjoyed every time.",10/10,RRR

NTR is such a great actor and he just signed this movie to get beaten up by other star and ram character I still don't understand it and just for his goal, he behaves more than a British and atrocious.It took 3 plus years for this movie
It costed like 2000 for a family to watch and they doubled up the prices for 2 weeks to collect more money....
It's a pure rip off.I am disappointed with Rajamouli this time as a fan...

What on earth was I watching?My face hurts from all the grimaces I must have unwillingly pulled.The levels of cringeworthiness are off the charts. The special effects are as abundant as they're pathetic. The dialogue is so wooden my ear might have caught a splinter. The patriotism is over-the-top and frankly ridiculous. And someone has watched way too many kung fu movies for their own good.I guess this is a great commercial concept for its home market and the Indian-background audience abroad, but it does not make a good movie.About the only remarkable thing is the amount of homoerotic tension between the main characters.

The most memorable scene is one against 1000! May watch more Indian movie in the future.

info-90701,2 June 2022,Oh my goodness!!,"As over the top action goes, this is up there with Tarzan and a host of the American made films. Pretty much cartoon style action adventure with incredible shots and well matched opponents.The cinematography is great, the story is not that unique, but the delivery is Bollywood on Bruce Willis of the 90's steroids. The actors are strong as they deliver an overall the top performance, and the music is interesting - perfect at times and too much at other times and like everything else, way over the top, as is the acting, to the point of comical often, but still worth it if only for the sheer nerve of it all! Of course it is as ridiculous as any war film is, since war is utterly absurd, but that is what it is. No sillier than any Rambo movie though.This film will absolutely and completely point out the abject evil of colonialism for sure, and the lostness of those who turn against their own, but that is a universal truth being told again and again in books, plays and films for centuries. It also speaks to the subterfuge of the double agent and the struggles they face. There's a lot going on in this film, but determination is the key to this story.Some of the brutality goes on too long, but apparently India is a brutal country. The cruelty with which powermonging monsters work to keep and exact that power is often astounding. Revolution is a powerful thing, and more often than not needed. This is apparent in this film. It is a tribute film to revolutionaries who fought to freedom under colonialism though I don't recognize most of the people at the end that they seem to be honoring. Still, good to know.It is well worth seeing if you like action. There is a combination of everything in this film. It is worth it for the sheer physicality of the movie if nothing else. These actors are no joke as action heroes go, and Bheem is India's McGiver! The stunts are off the chain! Looks like they had the same stunt coordinator as Patty Jenkins in Wonder Woman.It is just fun!",10/10,RRR

Usually I don't like songs and dance scenes in movies but this was just brilliant. If you don't like over the top action then this movie is not for you. It's a tale of two legendary people in pre-independent India. It shows how people were oppressed under the British empire. And it's realistic in that way. The racism was rampant and indians were treated like animals. This movie is a masterpiece and it had my full attention for three hours straight. And it was entertaining throughout. When I was watching I was wondering even Hollywood can't choreograph action scenes like these. It was just amazing. I don't have enough words to describe how entertaining this movie was. 10/10 must watch.,10/10,RRR

There's so much honour, love & sacrifice at the crux of the movie and it's covered so beautifully.And let's talk about the stunning visuals??!! Right from the start, there's so many beautiful frames and extremely well done shots/animation. Somehow every scene kept improving upon the next and halfway through you get immune to their super human strength. The sheer thought that went behind some of the scenes is just amazing.Couple of scenes in the middle and end (without spoilers) were just so brilliantly shot! The fight scenes are akin to Marvel's and I'm definitely in awe. I know I would definitely watch this again and recommend it to all.

It is one time watch in theatre. Some of the scenes are really good and a few might give you goosebumps but even those goosebumps aren't enough.I don't know how can people rate this 9 or even 10/10. It may be because of just being a hardcore fan but this is no way near the best direction of SS Rajamouli. Baahubali remains his best direction till date. RRR is far behind it. He might have to wait few more years to deliver a better gem than Baahubali.The acting of Ram Charan and NTR is really good and there's nothing much they could have done with such a poor story and script.Highly disappointed from the movie.",7/10,RRR
azemillancy,10 October 2022,VISUAL TREAT FOR A ONE-TIME-WATCH,"The movie ran well in the box office, collected a whopping 1,115 crore rupees, became Top 5 in Netflix US. A global sensation that is much hyped and successful in getting high ratings in many online movie review and rating platforms.When I watched the film in theatre, I felt goosebumps covering all over my skin. The experience felt indescribably great. But still it seems the movie isn't a great one.Visual Effects and Direction are all top-notch, one of the best in Indian Commercial Cinema. But something that is really necessary for a film to be good is a well-written screenplay, and that's what the film lacks horribly. The story is very weak and shallow that the director made all the aesthetic dependent on the breathtaking visual effects, larger-than-life protagonists and over-the-top action scenes.The action scenes are all well-shot and pulsating, and the defiance of physics doesn't have to be taken into consideration.Also at the same time, the most significant problem of the film lies here too. At the end of the film, it seemed like the whole movie was made only to be a gallery for action scenes. The exaggerated action scenes, even though they are good to watch, doesn't have a good story to be attached with. The story is too weak that it cant even be considered a story.Two guys form a friendship, later on splits apart and forms the friendship once again, and fights for their aim together. If I go for a better detailing it will end up in spoilers. The two lead characters are also resembled with historical and mythological characters, but even that wasn't given any proper writing. The lack of depths in characters and weak conflicts are the main problems that could be seen in the screenplay.It's a movie on a budget of 550 crores, but the story is not something that satisfy spending on that scale. And it's an SS Rajamouli film, the magnificence of his previous films like Baahubali is explicitly missing in RRR mainly due to the apparent lack of quality in the screenplay.Whatever it is, the film is still a watchable one. The visual effects and action scenes does the job of making the viewer stay focused on the screen till the end. But still, those VFX stunts are all just instant gratification, not something of good artistic value.",5/10,RRR
ramair350,22 July 2022,"An exceptional movie: beautiful, fun, and moving","I cannot believe what an amazing film has been created. I'm on old white American guy and am ashamed to admit that I at first was hesitant to try out the film. But it was absolutely an incredible experience from start to finish. American films seem dull and drab in comparison, especially the glut of comic superhero movies that have taken over the theaters. This movie does have superhero / comic elements in some regard, but in a way that appeals to me as an adult. I hope this movie gets the notice it deserves. Without question it should be an easy Academy nominee for cinematography. But for me I will put it on an even higher pedestal: it is the best film I have seen this year, period. Well done to everyone associated with the film; your passion and love for every detail really came through and connected with me. I thank you.

Sees All,8 January 2023,"Stupid, but very entertaining","What can I say about RRR? On one level, it's preposterous, ridiculous, and just plain stupid. However, it is also very entertaining. The near-capacity audience that I saw it with laughed all the way through it. It's an Indian movie and has most of the elements that make movies big hits in India: songs and dances (often popping up in the strangest situations), lots of martial arts scenes, violence and bloodshed attached to basically simplistic stories with innocent good guys and truly evil bad guys. Since the story takes place during the British Raj, it's the British who are the villains and the poor Indian villagers who are the victims. The story starts when a group of British aristocrats decide to take a little native girl who sings prettily away from her village and bring her to live in their household to entertain their guests. Her family does not want her to leave. The British throw a few coins at them and take the child anyway, (knocking the mother in the head during the process). The villagers are determined to get the girl back; the British are determined to show these ""brown trash"" who's boss. There are two attractive young men fighting on opposite sides in this struggle. They don't know that they are on opposite sides and swear fast friendship. You can only imagine the havoc that is wreaked when the truth is revealed to them, as both of them have superhuman strength. Their fights are elaborate and spectacular, no doubt inspired by the battles between Rama and the demons in THE RAMAYANA. Out of bullets? Just pick up your motorcycle and beat your opponent to death with it. The two guys are also great dancers (thanks to the aid of CGI). It all ends happily despite all the carnage. It's fun, but it's also long-more than 3 hours with an intermission. This film was awarded the New York Film Critics Award for Best Director. My question is: where does film direction end, and computer programming begin? The whole film looks like a violent video game. The good guys are pure of heart and look it. The bad Brits are an unattractive lot (fat and hairy for the most part); the head villainess looks remarkably like Jocelyn Wildenstein! RRR is entertaining, but I felt a little guilty about spending more than three hours viewing it. Would I recommend it? Only with an audience to laugh along with you.",6/10,RRR
panchalbhavesh-63503,1 April 2022,Little lengthy but musically sound and enjoyable,"First it is too long movie. Few frames of few seconds were chilling and more fulfilling than entire three hours of movie. Second, background score is too harsh at times and so sound design doesn't sound natural.Third, the hindi dubbed dialogues are not very convincing for the screenplay.Art direction is good which takes you to pre-independence era.Musically it is great.

ridi-arahan,28 March 2022,What makes a mission more than just a motivation and an ambitious goal!!,"What worked:
I personally felt this was superior Rajamuli movie compared to his former projects. One of the things that makes it a choice of the moviegoers is the ability to connect with the audience, making it a mass entertainer with its Elements of what we call a masala movie going experience. Ajay Devgn left a mark, short lived but a pivotal role so I am glad he made his impact in the movie. Both the leads were great in their roles and I would choose Ramcharan if I had to pick one , partially because he had a better narrative and also his acting. The production team put their work on right note and as a whole the movie worked. This movie is better than other projects that the director has been part of, both in execution and overall production value. The movie connects mostly with the audience, making it an entertainer and a enjoyable experience. Unlike his previous movies, it has less dull moments and over the top acting performances, but putting them in the context and applied when necessary. A big shout to the composer and the score; it's a treat. So, the movie works on the most part, which makes it a entertainer and a movie package to be celebrated rather than reviewed and analyzed. Bottomline is it works and the right chords are put together in this movie :
What did not work:
If I had chance, I would have worked on some technical aspect of the movie. Though better than previous movies, there were some room for improvements in editing and vfx team. Also, I would have been glad if the narratives had strong command, even more strong reasoning and motivations that guide the missions of the characters. Not saying, it's not there, but subtexts and sub layers would have made it better.Final verdict: it's a better Rajamuli project, and he has improved as a filmmaker. It does deserve a theatrical watch.",8/10,RRR
viccobra,22 May 2022,"If you're not from the culture, it's difficult not to laugh","My wife is bengali, and for her, this movie just makes sense, movie sense... for me, as a Swedish person, it's a laughing stock. Sort of like watching Twillight, things make no sense, crazy, unfathomable action scenes, followed by out of place music numbers(which is par for the course).The worst part is that I can't comment on the movie while watching with her, which would give me enjoyment, just like I got enjoyment from Twillight and The Room by making fun and laughing at the movies.So, if your significant other is fine with you commenting or making fun of the movie, you will enjoy it tbh. Because there is a lot to laugh at.

michellesharpe-16943,26 December 2022,Instant Classic!,"So, I'd heard people mention RRR. I saw the little Netflix reel with the tiger and thought, ""That's kind of awesome, but I don't think that movie is for me."" But then this movie gets nominated for best foreign language film at the golden globes and I hear there's outrage that India would've won the Oscar if they'd submitted this as their submission. Then I see that this movie is mentioned on almost every single ""Best of 2022"" list of the year. Then the Critics Choice nominate it for best picture. It's pretty rare when normal internet movie folks and critics alike share a mutual love for a movie. Let alone an action movie. So I finally decided to watch it.It took me about 20-30 minutes to turn the logical part of my brain off and enjoy the spectacle. Once ""Naatu Naatu"" hit, it was over. I was on board and in love with this movie.I pitch this movie to people by saying, ""It's like a mix of golden age Hollywood/musical movies, 80's action movies, 90's war movies, and classic buddy movies into one gigantic film."" By the sounds of it, you'd think this movie would be a tonal disaster. It is not. In fact, I think this is one of the most tonally balanced movies of the year. It also juggles the time nicely. I never once got bored watching this movie, and I watched it AT HOME! It is so hard to keep my attention at home, but this movie somehow achieved that.Definitely recommend this movie.

lingamanenijaswanth,1 April 2022,Carving but Unnatural,"Set in the 1920's, a short exaggerated outline which primarily focuses on different personalities & common enthusiastic quench among the two main roles. One of them on rescue mission of his kin whereas other fights to free from captivity of colonial power. Both meet as rivals but merged into as a revolutionary to accompany each other and achieve their goals.A short storyline which could end the movie in a short duration but rebellion is the one, which is stretched to fit into a time frame.

critiquerimdb,4 December 2022,Redefines the slick actioner genre in Bollywood,"Over the years, we have watched actioners in Bollywood consistently leaving much to be desired so much so that we concluded that this genre just comes with its limitations. An Action Hero breaks that myth. Billed as a slick-actioner, this film doesn't reduce itself to worshipping of shirtless male bodies, genre-contradicting slow-motion effects, non-sensically infused item numbers, melodrama, unfunny jokes or lazy writing clubbed with flying cars and blasting CGI. Right from the start, the director Anirudh Iyer takes the genre seriously and moves at a hyper pace almost giving the audience no time to absorb it. There are punches flying as fast as the punchlines and most, if not all, of them land with perfection. Even when An Action Hero concedes to the Bollywood remix dance number formula, it doesn't let go of its strong grasp with reality and its conviction for the story.It's applaudable how An Action Hero manages to tread the fine line between being condescending towards its own audience and being satirical towards the public at large with absolute finesse. The film is filled with references to real incidents but they aren't done in a self-eulogising manner - of which Bollywood is a repeat offender - rather it is a self-aware attempt at storytelling often critiquing itself along the way. Its critique through hilarious parodying of the ridiculous TRP-hungry media, fickle public perception and the corrupt establishment works as smoothly as Ayushmann Khurrana in parkour scenes.This is the most different role in Ayushmann's career and yet he slips into it with such ease that you'd forget that he's the same man commonly known as the torchbearer of social change in Bollywood. He delivers the charm of a star, the narcissism of a rich and famous man, the slick actions of a fighter and moral greyness of the protagonist with neatness. His screen presence is remarkable but his winning scene is definitely the one in the boat. Jaideep Ahlawat is a gem who doesn't slip up even once. His thuggish demeanor doesn't cease even in more toned down scenes.The only complaint is that when the film pivots in the second half, it forgets to take the audience along with it. The jokes remain funny and the action, bordering on the jumpscare, continues to be slick but the narration becomes less engaging. The film then rides on the very able shoulders of its lead actors until the climax when it all comes together in one swift flick.The film is entirely devoid of melodrama and filled with grey characters that the sanctimonious section of the masses would find hard to side and connect with. The film, thus, is a courageous attempt in a plethora of ways and calls for a necessary viewing. Go for it!",7/10,An Action Hero
arjunash-62280,3 December 2022,A Great Movie by Bollywood after Years!,"Will put it simply, the storyline is quite average but all the extra stuff in the movie (the comedy, action, twists) make it a movie worth watching. Not a min. Goes by in the entire movie which isnt exhilarating, every moment of the movie is pure excitement. Great job by Ayushmaan Khurana and even greater job by his co actor Jaideep. Also one of the funniest and action packed movie bollywood ever created. A feel of refreshing movie after a long list of never ending flops by the bollywood industry. Cheers to both the actors and directors for creating nothing short of a masterpiece worth watching.

SAMTHEBESTEST,3 December 2022,A Wannabe Intellectual Face-Off Goes Wrong With Excessive Heroism & Ultra Grand Theories.,"An Action Hero (2022) :
Movie Review -Anirudh Iyer's directorial debut, An Action Hero, sees Ayushmann Khurrana in the action zone for the first time and Jaideep Ahlawat in his regular flow. What Maneesh Sharma and Shah Rukh Khan's ""Fan"" (2016) and Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu's ""Driving Licence"" (2019) missed, An Action Hero got it right - a concrete theory to set up a clash between a star and a local man (here he is a big politician though). However, it goes over the top in the second half to make you believe that at the end it's just a Bollywood film, so the hero has to win. It does go wrong there, and some larger-than-life theories spoil it a little. An unexpected dose of comedy with organic humour is pleasant, whereas unnecessary heroism and grand theories halt it on an average level.Maanav Khurana (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a film star with the image of an action hero. He has some connections with bad people that involve him in the accidental death of Bhoora's (Jaideep Ahlawat) brother. Maanav flies out of the country to avoid police arrest and investigation, but little does he know that Bhoora is a bigger threat than the cops. The conversation between Maanav and Bhoora takes them on a rollercoaster chase in London, and then there are big surprises in the second half, mentioned above as 'grand theories'. Who is the hero and who's the villain? Or are they both not what they seem? And most importantly, who wins at the end?Anirudh Iyer's story starts off on a promising note, but it is a faulty script for today's audiences. A hero is nothing without a villain, and in the same way, a villain is useless if there is no hero to oppose him. We all know these basic rules, and that's what millions of mainstream audiences have been watching over the years. An intellectual face-off like ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) comes once in decades or maybe a millennium. And in Indian cinema, we have hardly managed to match half of that with ""Ayyappanum Koshiyum"" (2020). Anirudh couldn't grab that creativity while exploring the heroism of the hero and somewhere of the villain as well. His sense of humour in taking a dig at the media and stars is splendid, though (me, being a media person, saying this, can you believe it?). Also, the humour and comedy are far from the mediocrity that our so-called blockbuster films and directors show.Ayushmann Khurrana has had a dull year, but not as a performer. A couple of years ago, he changed the face of Bollywood with his pathbreaking choices, and all of them became box office hits. Now, in the post-Covid-19 era, things have changed, as has the fate of his films, and the audience has become a little bit more choosy than they were before. An Action Hero gives him a heroic image and does a good job. Jaideep Ahlawat is freaking good, as it seems he is in his own zone, being a powerful politician with a lot of attitude and ego. He looks like a perfect fit for the role, and you'll like his jokes because they have a Haryanavi flavour. The supporting cast adds more to this fun ride, while Akshay Kumar's cameo will surprise you. The two dancing divas, Malaika Arora and Nota Fatehi, appear in two songs, and they set the dance floor on fire with their super sexy looks and brilliant dancing skills.Talking about the technical aspects, An Action Hero is an enriching experience. The background score is excellent, the cinematography is superb, and the editing is edgy. The screenplay is pacy, excluding the last 20 minutes when you know that you are close to the conclusion and you start predicting the fates of the characters. Director Anirudh Iyer has a great sense of cinema, even though it's his own writing that pulls down An Action Hero. But as a director, he is surprisingly good and damn promising. You'll have to see how he has presented all those action scenes and the face off between Ayushmann and Jaideep. The dialogues are used smartly. He has planned things cleverly, and his knowledge about scene-making is simply too much for a newcomer. If it hadn't been for the writing, An Action Hero would have been a solid debut for him.

sameerlodaya,4 December 2022,Running hero,Sameer lodayaThe hero mentioned here is not an action one but a running heroSimple old script of revenge with a new spice that a film hero is involved..accidentally a big goon and politicians jaideep brother is killed by a big Bollywood hero Ayushmann now from the crime sight the hero swings from Haryana to London and it doesn't stop here the goon also immediately swings to London from Haryana..from here both the hero and goon are running from here and there in London which involves big mafia his punters all are runningNow in-this running story there is little humour which should be more as there was nothing else in the movie..some action was tried but couldn't succeed..suddenly a remix item number is presented by a 50 year old so called hot model and the movies reaches the absurd climaxJaideep is such a great actor but here he was not used and so is Ayushmann who also acted below normal and this is his 4th flopFans and followers are giving top ratings but that is not going to help audiences are very smart where to spend their money and timeThis weekend Freddy has taken over all releases.,4/10,An Action Hero

(fresh one)Jaideep Ahlawat - fine performance, delivers his best.Even if there were no songs in this film, it would have worked.A different storyline and perfect performance by both lead actors ayushmann khurana and Jaideep Ahlawat.Every scene has been played very well, it was not very long, that's why it was better.Story Twists and Turns are fitted perfectly with a Good Action Sequences and Cinematography.Just because of Both Lead Actors it's a Entertaining Movie.It's a Worth Weekend Watch.Review By itsbymayank - Mayank Bharat Bhushan Louteriya (Review of An Action Hero)",7/10,An Action Hero
Biswas_,2 December 2022,Pretty monotonous!,"This is probably Khurana's first full fledged action movie . I had a lot of expectations from it but it turned out to satisfy only half of it.The plot is quite interesting. A cat and mouse chase between an action hero and a person , blood thirsty for revenge. However ,the problem is that within sometime, it gets pretty monotonous.Theres action, then there's a chase, then there's action, then there's Chase.....and this continues throughout the film. While the chase sequences and action sequences are well shot, it tends to become too monotonous in the 2nd half making it a slightly tiring watch.The humor present works pretty well . BGM is amazing, especially the one you heard in its trailer. The climax is a bit crazy and still left me scratching my head.Ayushman Khurrana can do very good action. He should do more films like these and at least promote them well (this film is literally on zero buzz thanks to no promotions nothing). Audience are gonna love his action avatar as it is a breath of fresh air for the otherwise social message man. Jaideep is just fabulous!! His thirst for revenge is visible in his eyes and way of talking. His scenes with Ayushman are electrifying .Overall, a just about okayish film that will be enjoyed for its performances and few action chase sequences.",6/10,An Action Hero
emailbaljit,3 December 2022,Great action movie with great satire and dark humour,"Wow whatta movie. Went to theatre trusting few reviews and this movie turned out to be a blast. It had action, great satire, very topical jokes, great storyline and a revenge in the climax which India is waiting for many years. Fantastic acting by Jaideep Ahlawat and Ayushmann Khurrana. Shows AK continues to have a knack for picking great scripts. Loved that character based on Arnab Goswami, with lines Arnab has spoken in his career, it is hilarious . This movie is the best Hindi movie with original screenplay in last 2 years. AK brought back my faith in him. Kudos to Director too for keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie with Sriram Raghavan kind of dark humour touch.

nidhunmoviebuff,8 December 2022,"Ayushmann & Jaideep soar in this wickedly original, dazzlingly quirky action comedy","Whether it be his breakthrough role in ""Vicky Donor (2012)"" or his bravery in picking up uncomfortable subjects that typical heroes in Bollywood shy away from such as in ""Shubh Mangal Saavdhan (2017)"" (hero with erectile dysfunction) and ""Bala (2019)"" (balding hero), Ayushmann Khurrana has always managed to surprise audiences with his films. Just when one was starting to think that the star's career had hit a zenith and was on a downward spiral with recent flicks like ""Anek (2022)"" and ""Doctor G (2022)"" failing to make any impact at the box office, the virtuoso performer turns it up a notch with a film laced with razor-sharp wit and immense fun that is sure to entertain audiences across the spectrum.Ayushmann stars as ""Maanav Khurrana"" a quintessential egotistical Bollywood hero with an overblown sense of self, a clear satire on the mainstream heroes of the Hindi industry. How the star gets enters into a bitter feud with a Haryana strongman politician ""Bhurra"" (played by an immense Jaideep Ahlawat) and the ensuing chaos forms the rest of the story. Director Anirudh Iyer threads the needle with the screenplay, finding the right balance between bone-crunching action and rib-tickling zingers to keep audiences hooked.The script by Neeraj Yadav never lets up in the number of twists and turns it brings in during the chaotic journey of our two lead protagonists, with the excellent action choreography and stunts adding mass to the witty zingers and one-liners that form part of the cat and mouse chase. The storytelling and direction are so on-point that even the placement of an item number serves to move the narrative forward convincingly and without the tension and fun element dissipating. Ahlwat and Khurranna consistently one-up each other during their combination sequences, serving to elevate both their performances.After a string of pedestrian mainstream misadventures and template remakes, Bollywood has really turned a corner in 2022 with wholly original entertainers like ""Darlings"", ""Monica O My Darling"", ""Bhediya"" and now ""An Action Hero"". One hopes that the top film industry in India finally understands audience exhaustion with constant remakes and films that tread the beaten path and invests more time and energy towards fresher and more disruptive scripts and storylines. Trust Ayushmann to lead the way in this direction-"" An Action Hero"" is a surefire must-watch in theatres!",8/10,An Action Hero
ysecret,3 December 2022,Another great flick from Ayushman!,"Ayushman really knows how to choose great script. Loved the news anchors parts and their reaction at the end lol. Great acting by both Jaideep Ahlawat and Ayushman. Would love to see them again in some project. BGM also suited well with the screenplay. But in doubt on how many people will watch this movie in theatres, cause I think everybody is saving to watch Avatar way of water this December. Still if you are in for some good fun flick with great acting and good story, then you can go and watch this. There are so many hilarious jokes in the movie. Also loved the cameo by Akshay Kumar, he should do more cameos like this.

abhimanyusarin,3 December 2022,A true blue action movie,"First of all lemme say this OMG I really didn't expect this one to be a good watch as I couldn't imagine ayushman as an action hero and i personally always expect some good scripts along with a very strong message from his movies, but man i was sooo soooooo wrong.This movie is an action and laughter riot that stays soooo true to its name. Great action sequences and witty quirky one liners every 5 minutes. Lemme shed some light on how great an actor jaideep alahwat is. I mean there were so many instances where he didn't even needed to say anything and just makes you laugh with his amazing expressions. He has taken this movie to a next level all together with his presence. The movie has a good script and screenplay that supports the movie and holds it together till the very end.I would recommend this movie to any and everybody and is a through and through family mass entertainer unless you don't like action or comedy movies.",10/10,An Action Hero
joydeepzerocool,9 December 2022,Inconsistent but I thoroughly enjoyed it,"The movie was engaging. But the theme shifts in the 2nd half which was unpredictable inconsistent with the tone of the film but filled with fun and entainment. Few aspects were repetitive and unreal so but I just can't remember watching a such an awesome action flick in a long time.The theatre had only 8 people in the audience including me but experience was simply amazingAyushman Jaideep and the BGM were brilliant. The Twists and comedy were on point almost every time. Masood character was weird but it was essential for the movie.Awesome Bollywood masala action flick with great Acting, BGM and Script.

mehulpanwar-12642,6 December 2022,Really Really Really BAD,"I am speechless. Words are not enough to describe the disappointment I am feeling after watching Ayushman Khurana film.Everything from writing, to story, to humor, to action was broken in this film. Neither it was funny nor it had noteworthy action.Like wtf did i just watch. How can bollywood stoop to such a low standard. Songs were taken, sound effects were pathetic which didnt match the mood, like I don't know why and who decided to create this movie. I am so done with bollywood.As citizen I would urge people not to watch this movie and give a tight slap to the creators so they would know what happens when you make a low end, boring, unfunny, nonsense, nakli action movie.

Stereotype Villagers by defaming them, showing them cruel, uneducated, uncultured. Frames Bollywood celebs and naxalites as too good and victim of criticism. This movie is a mock on people who criticize Bollywood nowadays. Mock on government, army, Raw through jocks and sarcasms. Shows Bollywood as they are against underworld, which is totally opposite of reality. Pathetic cheap jokes, just unbearable. Too many sarcasms on audience. Bollywood is now totally frustrated.

rahulvaidya055,5 December 2022,Mockery of moviegoers,"A bit late in posting this review but quite important nevertheless. This is not a movie but a propaganda aimed at criticising and making fun of media and moviegoers. It portrays filmmakers and actors as victims of different situations that they have control whatsoever. It is aimed to counter the BoycottBollywood trend by showing actors as extremely hard working and sincere and blaming media and audience as responsible for the failure of movies in recent times. Since Ayushmann's movies are not getting traction among the audience these days, he blamed them publicly for the failure of his movies and then regurgitated the same crap in this movie also. It seems everyone in this movie is dumb except the main character and the villain. Till the time the villain also becomes dumb very conveniently. If bollywood understands that they have to stop insulting and demeaning their audience, their movies may work.

akshayminhas-28948,4 December 2022,Time wasting and unnecessarily lengthy,"25% of the movie has unnecessary scenes of news reporter just to pass time and look funny but it's was irritating. 20% of the movie is all about ayushman running from cops or villain. If it would not have been stretched unnecessarily then movie was ok.Jaideep Ahlawat acting was good. Ayushman was overacting. Writer has not put much of an effort to add more substance to the story because of which movie was made unnecessarily lengthy but unwanted stuff. There were one or two moments where audiences enjoyed the scenes rest all below average.Dialogues written were also below average apart from one or two instances. There was no creativity.

Remember that cliched scene from 90s where someone trips on the floor and hit their head so hard that they either loses their memory or dies yeah that is the inciting incident of the movie. The entire movie is about a big brother trying to avenge death of his younger brother and the unintentional murderer running away.Movie turns bizzare, senseless, directionless and utter non sense after that.The Bollywood is making fun of the media, rightfully so, but in the process also ended up making fun of audience, the boycott trend, R&AW and UK police and their laws.Finally to enhance the impact and give it an absurd ending some high-profile terroristi who is always on the FBI's list of top most wanted terrorist enters the scenario and the movie seals it's place among the worst movies of all time. It's not even an exaggeration.A big brother trying to avenge his younger brother's death keep switching teams with the murderer of his younger brother ends up dying because he wasn't as useful antagonist as the terrorist.Avoid the positive reviews, downvoting of negative reviews and don't watch the film.",3/10,An Action Hero

Just like a typical action hero, he is strong, fearless and stylish. But he doesn't have a back story - he hasn't worked in the trenches, lost everything or fought his way to the top. He is infact privileged, 2 citizenships, lots of money. He is also a narrassitic jerk and remains so throughtout the film. He also doesn't have a strong motive. - he is just surviving.In fact, the film gives all these traits to Bhoora Jaideep Alawaat's character - who plays the antagonist - A self-made man, who has come up the ranks and created a clout for himself. A clout that is challenged along with his ego, when an actor kills off his younger brotherWhile the writing and direction is clever, witty and the humour, so relevant and oh so self-aware.

shubhamjohri-2012,5 December 2022,"Created by Mallya, Nirav Modi sympathisers","A movie actor, Maanav, unintentionally kills the younger brother of an incumbent political leader, flees to the fraudster sanctuary aka The United Kingdom, gets followed by the vengeful politician 'Bhoora' whose brother he killed by accident, and a cat-and-mouse chase ensues.Bhoora sneaks into Maanav's London house and kills 2 policemen to frame Maanav. Maanav flees the house and tries to secure CCTV footage to prove his innocence. However, he is dragged away by goons of a gangster who fled India and now lives in the UK. Maanav had given out controversial interviews to the media in the past, stating that the Underworld is no longer relevant. To assert his dominance, the gangster makes Maanav dance at the former's granddaughter's wedding. Meanwhile Bhoora arrives at the scene, tries to kill Maanav but ends up shooting the gangster by mistake.Maanav tries to convince Bhoora that he is innocent, Bhoora replies that the ""pehlwan"" (ego) within him can't accept that. Maanav ends up shooting Bhoora with his own gun. He surrenders to the London police and inks a deal with the Indian criminal agencies, pretending to have been the one to kill the gangster -- saying that the agencies might lose public faith if people come to know that Maanav shot dead a high profile gangster in a single day -- something the agencies couldn't do in 30 years.Maanav is welcomed with garlands in India. Agencies disclose to the media that Maanav was sent on a secret mission to the UK to kill the gangster. Everyone forgets about the politician and his younger brother.---The movie tries to convince you that Maanav is innocent. He is not, atleast not without a trial. It tries to show the media in a bad light -- one day the media is condemning Maanav for the killing, conducting media trials and writing sensational headlines for TRP; the next day, they are praising him for felling the gangster.The world conveniently forgets that Maanav still has to face trial for the killings even if he is a hero in the public's eye. The judiciary is not subject to popular support.The movie mentions that when a rich man is having a bad day, the poor will pounce on him and make a mountain out of a mole hill. Could be true, but the rich aren't ""doodh ke dhule"" either with how they abuse their money and power to get out of difficult situations.",7/10,An Action Hero

paragsgandhi,8 December 2022,Action/comedy mix par excellence,"Imagine Ayushman as an action hero!! One simply can't. But he completely surprises you with his stunts and thrills. Add to that the comic timing and the action/fun scenes between him and Alhawat. The entire storyline is out of the box, and it needs a producer and directors courage to make it and a star actor's risk-taking ability to make it. Overall, it's a superb movie and deserves all the love and success of movie fans. It's a unique movie worth watching. One just hopes that public taste changes, else we will be deprived of more such novel movies. This experiment should be apprecited as the comedy is not at all valgour and its a complete family watch.

Poor story, lack of genre,which will definitely confuse the audience. The story definitely lacks the content. From starting to ending of the movie
You will feel like what/why is it happening. Meaningless story. Action scenes are great, background music is nice, villain is weak, with poor character and agenda. It will give u Hollywood kind of vibe initially but in the mid n ending like typical Bollywood masala movie.Ayushman does surprised us by his different avatar in different movies. But this time it is not his best one.

aravindhvcse,4 December 2022,Absolutely new Cinematic Experience,"Fantastic movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie was outstanding. Climax was out of the box thinking. Ayushmann and Jaideep nailed their roles. Bgm was sensational. The way of narration of the climax makes me completely love the film. The way every character was introduced with their respective Bgm was very much notable. The Background Score gave very much life to the characters and the film. Many would have come for Jaideep but they will definitely fall for Ayushmann. Man he stole the show. Must watch. Infact it could be watched several times. Beautiful experience for a cinema lover. Guys don't miss it in theatres.

kabirjazz,16 December 2022,Amazing performance by every cast,"Film is amazing nice story line, music, comedy everything at best.Numbers might be low because of some bollywood mentality about movies these days. But definitely it will do wonders on OTT and global television.It will remain in hearts forever..one who can watch it once.. i have seen in theatre.waiting to watch one more time on OTT.Ayushmann always tries something different to audience and in a every possible way to deliver such amazing performance. No matter what numbers came but movie is worth to watch not even once but twice. Always a masala or romantic songs won't work. Movies of this genre should be appreciated.

tandaananya,19 December 2022,Great Action and Accurate Humour!,"This is a male centric movie with a lot of action which will definitely give the goosebumps to the audience who enjoy this genre. This movie is about a person who is a famous and reputed actor but gets accused of a murder. He tries to prove in the movie that he is not a culprit and has to fight so many times. Script style and dialogue delivery actually attracts the audience. The acting done by the actors is commendable and Jaideep Ahlawat has also done some remarkable performance which I think deserves more recognition. Ayushmaan Khurana is a show stealer here and the end of the movie is quite satisfactory.

rajharsh-72663,6 December 2022,Ayyshmann is besttt,"One of the best movies of 2022. Thriller& surprises.There are also surprise in terms of big stars. I'm seeing that there are no good box office collection for this film This film definitely needs more audience attention. I had gone to watch this film with very low expectations but Ayushman as always stands out. The film is perfect example of entertainment and is a must watch for the audiences who want to laugh and thrill at same time. Other actors of the film are also great and don't disappoint. Ayushmann showed that he can single handedly entertain the audience and he doesn't need a female co-star.

alphadude007,11 December 2022,A mediocre attempt at a Bollywood Guy Ritchie,"I saw - An action hero, in the theatre. The movie was definitely engaging, but it is not a visual spectacle or stunning by any means to warrant a theatre watch. It would be a good OTT movie. So, for people thinking about watching it, I would suggest to wait for an OTT release.I felt the movie had a Guy Ritchie feel to it, with all the gangesters and the black comedy. And it was pretty well executed as well. I am fully willing to let go of logic etc. In an action movie, IF, the characters and the plot is engaging enough. The problem with this movie is that both are very loosely written and shot. So, a lot of the idiosyncrasies, black comedy, lack of logic etc. Don't work at all since other than Ayushmann's character, you don't have a connection, feel or bond towards another character. This is a major drawback of the movie. Ayushmann has done well, the rest of the cast is pretty so so. Not a lot of laugh out moments, but it is an engaging movie and a timepass watch.

vajidjkhan,6 December 2022,Amazing Acting By Ayushman Khurana,"Don't wanna say much or spoil anything.Just know this it's very entertaining, sometimes a little fine, mostly action were quite realistic so that's a plus for me
And story is the charm
A new and unique, I haven't seen a similar one
And believe me I watch just too many movies, like too many
So I haven't watched everything
But still it's enough to let me know if it's something that suits me
Bahubali or rrr, were just not my type as I just can't stay my head focused and ignore the mistakes everywhere
It's like I just can't and sometimes dialogues just go too much fake or let's say dramatic, so I just am not into that
Still they were all good time pass
But rarely i actually enjoy a movie
And this was such
How this actor changed and grow and I love hypocrisy or darkness or maybe evil. Which it wasn't. But it was good enough for me to refer to it as a bit psychological or maybe let's just good twist and turns and game change and character change, like let's just say finally becoming criminal ig
Compared to Salman or srk most movies which sell due to stardom or similar other stars, this here, right here, this movie is different.Anyway ignore me
I just enjoyed it right now and am writing right after watching it lol
So maybe I also exaggerated a bit
Btw bgm was nice, it suits very well

People often complain regarding remakes happening in Bollywood but those people never go watch and admire these kind of films with true potential ! The mixture of Dark humour and Jaideep sir is so hilarious üî•...and it slaps the media by imitating parodies in the film which is true in most sense nowadays !

Ayaan494968,13 December 2022,An Action Hero,"An Action Hero (2022) : Movie Review -Anirudh Iyer's directorial debut, An Action Hero, sees Ayushmann Khurrana in the action zone for the first time and Jaideep Ahlawat in his regular flow. What Maneesh Sharma and Shah Rukh Khan's ""Fan"" (2016) and Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu's ""Driving Licence"" (2019) missed, An Action Hero got it right - a concrete theory to set up a clash between a star and a local man (here he is a big politician though). However, it goes over the top in the second half to make you believe that at the end it's just a Bollywood film, so the hero has to win. It does go wrong there, and some larger-than-life theories spoil it a little. An unexpected dose of comedy with organic humour is pleasant, whereas unnecessary heroism and grand theories halt it on an average level.Maanav Khurana (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a film star with the image of an action hero. He has some connections with bad people that involve him in the accidental death of Bhoora's (Jaideep Ahlawat) brother. Maanav flies out of the country to avoid police arrest and investigation, but little does he know that Bhoora is a bigger threat than the cops. The conversation between Maanav and Bhoora takes them on a rollercoaster chase in London, and then there are big surprises in the second half, mentioned above as 'grand theories'. Who is the hero and who's the villain? Or are they both not what they seem? And most importantly, who wins at the end?Anirudh Iyer's story starts off on a promising note, but it is a faulty script for today's audiences. A hero is nothing without a villain, and in the same way, a villain is useless if there is no hero to oppose him. We all know these basic rules, and that's what millions of mainstream audiences have been watching over the years. An intellectual face-off like ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) comes once in decades or maybe a millennium. And in Indian cinema, we have hardly managed to match half of that with ""Ayyappanum Koshiyum"" (2020). Anirudh couldn't grab that creativity while exploring the heroism of the hero and somewhere of the villain as well. His sense of humour in taking a dig at the media and stars is splendid, though (me, being a media person, saying this, can you believe it?). Also, the humour and comedy are far from the mediocrity that our so-called blockbuster films and directors show.Ayushmann Khurrana has had a dull year, but not as a performer. A couple of years ago, he changed the face of Bollywood with his pathbreaking choices, and all of them became box office hits. Now, in the post-Covid-19 era, things have changed, as has the fate of his films, and the audience has become a little bit more choosy than they were before. An Action Hero gives him a heroic image and does a good job. Jaideep Ahlawat is freaking good, as it seems he is in his own zone, being a powerful politician with a lot of attitude and ego. He looks like a perfect fit for the role, and you'll like his jokes because they have a Haryanavi flavour. The supporting cast adds more to this fun ride, while Akshay Kumar's cameo will surprise you. The two dancing divas, Malaika Arora and Nota Fatehi, appear in two songs, and they set the dance floor on fire with their super sexy looks and brilliant dancing skills.Talking about the technical aspects, An Action Hero is an enriching experience. The background score is excellent, the cinematography is superb, and the editing is edgy. The screenplay is pacy, excluding the last 20 minutes when you know that you are close to the conclusion and you start predicting the fates of the characters. Director Anirudh Iyer has a great sense of cinema, even though it's his own writing that pulls down An Action Hero. But as a director, he is surprisingly good and damn promising. You'll have to see how he has presented all those action scenes and the face off between Ayushmann and Jaideep. The dialogues are used smartly. He has planned things cleverly, and his knowledge about scene-making is simply too much for a newcomer. If it hadn't been for the writing, An Action Hero would have been a solid debut for him. Nevertheless, it's a decent film that has unnecessarily gone into the exaggeration zone.",8/10,An Action Hero

Thank you Ayushmann for yet another wonderful film, you've worked so hard in your action scenes as well as your dance ones and it shows. Living in the UK we have had many of our cinemas closed down locally and so it's hard to get to the cinema for Bollywood, I've had to travel 40 miles but you are worth it!!! Please do not be put off by box office figures keep going strong and power through it!!! We have also got lazy and prefer to watch at home and wait for it to come on streaming platforms because it takes a matter of weeks to wait. The director was great too and I hope he continues to make great cinema!!! Thank you.

All the scenes were disconnected from one another. I wasted my whole time watching this. None should spend a second thinking about this film. Ayushman khurana is good for movie with an odd message, but he is not clearly suited for being an action hero, His expression and acting was so bad too. Other actors couldn't contribute anything good either.****Spoiler Alert***
One guy is randomly killing everyone bcz his ego is hurt.is this a film?? Ayushman is just doing actions without any reasons. No good songs are included in the film.

We do not feel the pain of the main character, we barely even get a sense of what she is going through.Acting is sub par, background score is lacking any kind of depth. This movie falters in every single department. Gives the message that police and judiciary are unavailable and issues should be dealt with at a personal level.

manojtyagiji,6 January 2023,Direction is Masterclass,"Sujith, Devika's husband, initially lashes out when she tells him of the sexual assault, even accusing her of causing it. There is, what feels like, redemption for the character who realises his mistake and wants to set things right, but the damage has been done to the relationship. Devika is unforgiving when he begs for a second chance. The climax denies him redemption when we realise that the 'acceptance' and 'support' were conditional to her getting an abortion. Amala Paul shows flashes of maturing as an actor, but the film, unfortunately, demands only versions of three emotions - anger, disgust, and grief - in a loop. It is disturbing that the characters believe they have no hope of justice, but take the law into their hands.

maryellen2728,29 December 2022,Loved it until the last 15 minutes,"I loved the main character. Her husband really behaved badly after learning what happened to her. I loved the mother-in-law supporting her daughter-in-law so passionately. Everything was so good until the super-unrealistic ending. Spoiler ahead. Numchucks? Really? And no woman, let alone a man, is gonna knock a man off his feet with a slap. Remember Chris Rock at the Oscar's? And the goon that was supposed to be protecting her/doing the revenge is sitting on the steps, letting her kick-ass. Then he pulls a ceiling fan down onto the idiot kids. It turned into Japanese anime at the end. So disappointed. It had so much potential.",6/10,The Teacher
Suhaymah5216,6 January 2023,Amazing,"The Teacher is not easy to watch, films about sexual violence seldom are. What is unsettling is that the perpetrators are barely out of school, and the victim/survivor is a teacher they meet during an inter-school competition. Even more disturbing is their nonchalance about the assault, which they have recorded. Her allies include her mother-in-law Patton Kalyani, a pan-chewing, beedi-puffing Communist party activist essayed brilliantly by Manju Pillai. Kalyani is appalled that her son cannot understand the severity of the crime and the trauma Devika has undergone. Manju Pillai could have been utilised more, but then it is Devika's story.

PANDIAN120621,27 December 2022,A well-intentioned revenge drama....!,"Amala paul has shown some matured and responsible act in potraying a strong women of substance,though struggling with frustration,fear& clueless and emotional at times doesn't let down courage and determination against the odds,A notable flick to rejoice in her career...
Hakkim Shah does a neat job holds a griping and balanced act in lending a valuable support to the flick...
Manju pillai and chemban Jose do weave a strong web of communist act and hatred against the odd of the high society crimes
The climax was bit surprising and convincing makes sure the screenplay and plot does fall in a safe ground of women empowerment.

santubhattacharjee,31 December 2022,Complete hit and miss,"The film tried to be something else but turned out something else at the end. The plot and characters were developed till the last 15 mins. But everything went to drain and unrealistic screenplay came to the front. The climax may have brought some adrenaline rush but not that impactful what the movie has planned to be. Overall a great effort but climax has ruined it all.Amala Paul did her best to portray the character to perfection. The confusion, disgust, and helplessness were well portrayed. Ultimately the screenplay went Hayward with new character being introduced from nowhere just to put sense into the climax. But as I said, it was forcefully done and not convincing.

serenapapanek,27 December 2022,Confusing,"Maybe it's the language barrier and that's completely on me.. however, I just felt so confused as to where the movie was going, it was so up and down it left me so confused, I understood the message but at the same time didn't because the revenge was a bit much, I just truly felt like it was all over the place with what the plot was really about, I give it a 5/10 because I do think it had good potential and was a great story especially culturally and how much women aren't believed when they're attacked and I'm happy she turned into a bad ass and won in the end I just felt very confused with it.

Heroine carrying the baby of the rapist and ditching her husband to show her braveness. Bravo climax, nice message to the society.Its the feminist view that a guy has to give freedom and accept whatever his partner does but the opposite isn't acceptable.Also they added masala fight scenes in the climax which is not even believable to the audience.

sanjaymohanakurup,23 December 2022,Needed more realistic elements in story,"Profile image
Sanjay Kurup
just nowThe emotion behind the story is good. Introductory cinematography was also superb though the story had a lot of lag in abundance. I felt for a moment to switch to something else . But I still glued myself thinking at least i should not reject a Malayalam movie based on such thoughts. So I continued. Even much before the story revealed the scenario one was able to make out where is the story heading to. The surprise factor was not present. I was just checking how far am I right with the story. Yes at some places it is also gripping and let's the viewers feel the notion. But sadly towards the end the story winds up so fast in unbelievable. The teacher decided on everything and suddenly she steps up to meet the guy. Where we are still expecting her to be raped again , she turns to be a karate and trained to kill fighter. Slowly all excuses revealing how powerful the teacher was in her past gets revealed. So does the sympathy to the character gets lost..The story fails to spread a good message
Music is good also the acting of all actors are good , art and other elements also did good. If the complications that was pilled up towards the end was composed in a more realistic manner . The story could have got more impact than what it did now.",5/10,The Teacher

Palin7449,6 January 2023,blockbuster,"Despite all the explanatory threads, The Teacher sticks to a tight two hours. However, one can't help but wonder why actors Nandu, Mala Parvathy, Dinesh Prabhakar and footballer/actor IM Vijayan all figure in the film in blink-and-miss roles! What little we see of these three actors' work is very well executed, but why are they there? Chemban Vinod has a substantial role since it is a cameo, and Anumol has a bit more to do. An aspect of the climax where Devika literally takes on her attackers is problematic. Chemban Vinod's character says he is not interested in women; the inference drawn is that he is queer. So when he enters and closes the door to a room with one of the attackers inside, the suggestion is unsavoury especially when we hear the younger man shout for help. Having a queer character is great, but makers have to be sensitive about how they are portrayed. If its releases on any ott. I wll watch on it. Definitely It's gonna be a blockbuster movie.

fahisfaizy,29 December 2022,Loved it,"It takes you through the emotions and trauma a rape victim goes through. And the fear of being Victim shamed. The twist at the end seemed a bit unrealistic, but keeping in mind, she has been Gym teacher all along, it makes sense how she was able to physically fight, and have mastered it already. .However it felt really strange that everybody in the story was completely against filing a police complaint. That rather seemed not true in a society we live in today. And at the start of the movie, when child who was molested being introduced, it seemed really unrealistic that they decided against filing an FIR.Over all the movie is a one time must watch.",10/10,The Teacher

Thanna9249,7 January 2023,A remarkable movie,"A remarkable movie. Watch it.,Vivek is a Director that is here to stay! Watch out!,Watched Teacher on Netflix....good movie 4/5 solid script, good performances and excellent twist in the end! ,I dont think there is a more convincing performance from Amala Paul in recent times. She just nailed it! Watch it for just her performance and the subject. Kudos to the maker!,Under 2 hours movie. Slow burner, loved the climax! This is a gem. Don't miss!!,Definitely a hidden gem in the 2022 Malayalam films I saw. What a narrative, great performances. The mother of husband is the best for me! Malayalam cinema is on a roll.,,,,,

Madangopal1532,7 January 2023,Totally recommended,"Missed this film in theatre. I am glad as its such a personal viewing film. Not everyones cup of tea but worked wonders for me. Totally recommended if you like regional content oriented films.,If you have not watched Teacher yet, then please just go on Netflix and watch it right now!!! Loved this gem!!!!,Malayalam cinema never disappoints. Just like the original way of thinking and writing. It is really organic. Teacher is a film for you, if you are looking for an emotional thriller!,Not a big fan of Amala Paul, but this film has got me to think otherwise. She is such a good performer. She needs to do more Malayalam films rather than wasting time in Tamil.,,,,,,,

samxxxul,18 August 2022,Wholesome and humane in equal doses.,"It is obvious why these kinds of movies are tailor made for actor Dhanush. They are about the common man, close to reality, where the main character is a bit of the viewer and relatable. So i was prepared to witness another tried and tested role in many ways similar to his early films where he plays a simple middle class boy.Coming to this film, the idea is not at all new, and there was a fear that the movie might sink into the genre melodrama of broken family, father-son-grandpa relationship with forced tearjerker moments. Well, it tried to avoid all the tested stereotypes of love and family entertainer genre even if it is predictable. But the let down is towards the climax, nevertheless, I was glad to see Dhanush in this movie right from the unusual introduction, he didn't deviate from the character. He breaks out of his 'action hero' role and steps into the shoes of Pazham, the title character, stuck in the crisis of middle class family, trapped with his Grandad, Father and Best friend always tiptoeing around with loud mouthed talks which leads to funny cat and mouse tug-of-war and gentle moments in the film.Major highlight is definitely Nithya Menen who plays Shobana, best friend of Pazham (Dhanush). She does her best despite all the hopelessness of the situation to stay true as a girl bestie, her clumsiness, quirky moments are nice and it will make you gradually feel great sympathy and hope for a happy end when these two are on screens. Many will want to tag along with a character like Shobana, very kind, supportive, faithful and all these words are also not enough for her.To summarize, this film combined with dramedy, family values, background score, quirky moments adding charm to the meter of all the characters including the cameo of other 2 actress is pleasure to watch. On the other hand, i wished the film could have ended like how a Jonathan Levine, Noah Baumbach, Y√ªya Ishii, John Carney, Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit or Cooper Raiff's Cha Cha Real Smooth (2022) will tend to, a bittersweet ending. Please don't consider this as a big negative, just give it a watch with minimal expectations as the film is all in the best traditions of the genre to make you feel wholesome with equal doses of drama and emotion. A nice and worthy addition to actor Dhanush filmography.",7/10,Thiruchitrambalam
narmoletyl,18 August 2022,Thank you,"This movie is just amaizing.You can find all √©motions you need.All actors performances was super and they keept the meter needed. Songs are incredible, Aniruth explored a new dimension. The screen play was Nice and cinematography also. We can easily relate with Dhanush's character. At this point in tamil cinema, we need more movies like that.Verdict : A super feel good movie to watch with family. üôå

RameshJ85,19 August 2022,Nitya Menon nailed it,"After Sita Ramam one more love story with pure emotions. Nitya Menon and Dhanush gave their best. Overall it's not a new story but director written screenplay very well. Captured many emotions in the story and release them one by one eventually. Had seen whistles in love and emotional scenes. Kudos to director. Anirudh given decent magic. In VIP movie mother song was super hit here father song will be super hit. Bharati Raja sir comedy timing super.

Story was pretty simple , but movie never failed to entertain and gave us a feel good vibe . Characters in the movie was well written especially Shobana ( Nithya Menon ) character was impressive and Thiruchitrambalam ( Dhanush ) character was relatable one . Movie was more entertaining due to it had many relatable moments and I admired each and every part . After long DnA combo came together and once again they created magic - songs and music were good , actually I wasn't satisfied with ""Thai Kelavi"" song at first , but after theater watch I really liked it . Visuals were topnotch , cinematography and lightings gave great support to the movie . There were some flaws but postives overlapped negatives . Finally after long time Mithran Jawahar gave us a well made feel good family entertainer . A Good weekend watch ahead for you .

arungeorge13,3 September 2022,Candid. Relatable. Beautiful. Slice of Life. [+74%],"Thiruchitrambalam brings back the Dhanush we all love and then some! Writer-director Mithran Jawahar concocts a simple, slice-of-life tale with Dhanush playing a character the whole world can relate to, punctuated by the candid relationship he shares with his grandpa (Bharathi Raja, who does an amazing job!) and best friend (Nithya Menen, displaying infectious energy and eating up the screen). There's also the uneasy equation he has with his cop dad (Prakash Raj, beautifully essaying his character) and things that take place within their middle-class household. This is the kind of movie where you want to send hearts and smiling emojis out to the screen every couple of minutes, as it makes you feel like these characters really exist in a Chennai neighborhood.Thiruchitrambalam essentially ticks all boxes when it comes to a Dhanush film with confused love interests. We have the infatuation phases, the quick break-ups (before love even blossoms), personal redemption arcs, and of course, late realizations on love and familial ties. Yet, the film remains delightfully entertaining throughout (with some emotional moments) and there isn't a single dull moment in the narrative. Quintessentially speaking, this is the Dhanush I'd like to see more of in Tamil cinema (alongside whatever he does with Vetrimaaran, Mari Selvaraj, and co.), given he's already in demand from so many industries, Hollywood included! Also, big thanks to Anirudh for that lovely soundtrack.",7/10,Thiruchitrambalam

The father suddenly suffers a paralytic stroke and this incident brings him closer to his son. #Thiruchitrambalam is an enjoyable family entertainer with amazing performances by the entire cast, especially Bharathiraja and Prakash Raj. Rating 3/5.

nidhunmoviebuff,20 August 2022,Dhanush & Nithya Menen sparkle in this formulaic but fun feel-good romcom!,"Romantic comedies are perhaps the most over-exhausted, overexplored genre in all of cinema, with almost every cinematic trope having been done to death. And yet, Thiruchitrambalam proves that two sparkling lead performers can make even the most cliched plotline engaging and charming, immersing you into their world with their authentic portrayals. Dhanush and Nithya Menen combine to such devastating effect that you cannot help but get swept up in the sheer fun and frolic they unleash on screens before you and leave the cinema hall will a wide grin plastered over your face.After the twin debacles of ""Jagame Thandiram (2021)"" and the shambolic ""Maaran (2022)"" Dhanush returns to his home genre that made him such a household name. In a character eerily similar to his role in the cult-hit ""Velaiilla Pattadhari (2014)"", Dhanush plays ""Thiru"", a disgruntled, troubled young man eking out a living as a food delivery man constantly living under the turmoil of a torrid past. His only solace in life is ""Shobhana"" (the effervescent Nithya Menon), his best friend and close confidante, who constantly tries to motivate and encourage him to do better in life.This dynamic duo reels you into their messy lives and their search to find Thiru a suitable girl, all the while trying to sort out his familial issues and slipshod career. Infused with foot-tapping music from the always dependable Anirudh Ravichander, director Mithran Jawahar's breezy narrative style keeps you continuously engaged and sold fully on the protagonist's plight. Bharathiraja is an absolute hoot as Thiru's quickwitted grandfather, generating some of the film's best comedic moments with his one-liners and zany quirkiness.Raashi Khanna and Priya Bhavani Shanker make little to no impact in bit-part roles but they were specifically designed to be such by the director. The chemistry between Dhanush and Nithya Menen is so palpable that they can carry the entire narrative of the film on their capable shoulders. Despite a cliched, formulaic storyline with no real surprises, their witty banter, constant bickering, and how they cheerfully navigate the hurdles that life throws in their way become all too relatable and consistently entertaining. Recommended!",8/10,Thiruchitrambalam
PavanKV,8 September 2022,"Fills your heart with happiness, light heartedness and humanness","Thiruchitrambalam- A rich platter containing simple/effective story, heart touching, emotional, bonding with family, rib tickling & spot on comedy, situational frustration and breezy love story. This movie is a blessing and conveys how a powerful script with a strong screenplay can be a crowd pleaser without any flashy budget nor graphics.Amazing acting by Dhanush, Nithya Menon, Bharathiraj and Prakash Raj. It's pure, joyful and fills your heart with happiness, light heartedness and humanness.Bravo to the entire team for the great work as it really provides the calm, soothing effect and also a great watch for the family audience.

vishnu_karthiklu,18 August 2022,Thumbs Up for Thiruchitrampalam,"Thiruchitrampalam is a Feel-good, Rom-com movie. The story is about Thiru, a college drop-out delivery guy. Performances of Dhanush as Thiru and Nithya Menon as Shobhana were the biggest positives for the movie. Rashi Kanna, Prakash Raj, Bharathi Raja have done pretty good job. Music helps the movie to hold audience's attention. Editing cuts are totally great. Even the story is predictable and cliche at some parts, it has its heart at the right place. Movie has a runtime of around 133 minutes which is crisp. Among the recent action thrillers, give this proper feel good movie a watch. Definitely recommended.

Father and son screenplay moving very well. Totally fully packing movie..",9/10,Thiruchitrambalam
ngandacinema,5 September 2022,A predictable scenario,"So, we're not much of Dhanush's fans but we have to say in Thiruchitrambalam he made his way to our hearts ! What an awesome rendition on his part!We predicted Thiruchitrambalam's scenario (except for the father-son relationship) right from the start to the point that we weren't surprised when events were unfolding.Nithya Menen (playing Shobana) appeared to be overdoing it, even her laughter seemed forced; there was no natural touch
We've seen countless stories about an unassuming guy with a female best friend trying to navigate different experiences. Hence, it was a no-brainer who Pazham would end up choosing for a partner. The way the characters were designed was so typical that there wasn't much thrill to ThiruchitrambalamA side note: the rudeness that adult children display towards elders these days in cinema is a little shocking and somehow readily accepted üò®, e.g. Shobana's conduct towards her mom and Pazham's dad.",2/10,Thiruchitrambalam
personalacc-87247,24 August 2022,A great film!,"A good entertaining film, Every character was written beautifully.Do watch this with your family,

manirsoffl,18 August 2022,Will not satisfy everyone,"First of all its a very well casted film. Dhanush,Prakash Raj,Bharathi Raaja sir and the very charming Nithya Menon. Trust me you will fall for Nithya on screen. Aniruth's score seemed a mix of vip vibes. Screenplay was nice and duration is not lengthy these are all good things of it. And yes Dhanush after a long time on theatres but he chose not to do a mass/masala film and thats a good thing too. But what looks here flat was there is no such grippy or even emotionally connected story. They have tried to just moves the story with bunch of moments yet its missing something and finally the climax is what made me disappointed not everyone's cup of tea,well its obviously not mine.

rosheenkan,2 October 2022,Dhanush comeback film is great,"Since his OTT films failed to impress the audiences, Dhanush is back in theatres since Karnan. I thought this will become the disappointment for his fans but suddenly it getting rave reviews.For Sun Pictures their previous films ET and Beast were average grosser and hit respectively but already the film has a profitable venture.Anirudh music particularly Thaai Kelavi and other songs make me gone in disco mode. Dhanush performance is great and also father-son-grandpa works well.Since this is Dhanush comeback theatrical released film, this will probably his best film since Karnan and Asuran.

rajnnair,4 October 2022,Must Watch,"Thiru lives with his father & grandfather. He has not talked to his father for the last 10 years but he is close with his grand father with whom he has a good connect. The scenes between these three are a delight to watch.The anger owards his father which is a result of an incient and he blames his father for the state he is in.The other track in tis movie is the relationship Thiru shares with his childhood friend shobhana. She loves him but does not express it and Thiu is not aware of the same. The scenes between them are a delight to watch specially in the second half.Dhanush is superb as Thiru, and goes through the emotion of angs, desperation and loss with aplomb. Nithya as shobhana is amazing, matching with Dhanush which takes te movie to another well.Prakash as the father and Bharathiraja as the grandfater are good.The music score is good and the song are choeograohed well.A must watch.",9/10,Thiruchitrambalam
warrior03,7 September 2022,Fun romcom,"The story that been beaten to death girl and boy childhood friends need I say more...but a feel good film nonetheless . Dhanush and nithya chemistry was cute. Priya bhavini is a blink or miss role . Don't even want to mention about the other girl role. The segment between grandson grandfather and father is sweet. Pacca paisa vasool and entertainment guaranteed I enjoyed it . I would Def recommend it as a one time watch for sure. Also anirudh music is simply superb I loved Thai kilavi and Megham karukuthai. Now since imdb requires atleast 600 character I am going to posting some bla bla bla and some more bla bla bla.

m-ramanan,24 August 2022,Fantastic first half and templated second half,"RATED 8/10
Language: Tamil
Source: Nil
RECOMMENDEDGood family drama with lot of sparkling moments... mostly because of Nithya... The first half is quite surprising and superb one... the family, love and friendship bonding was presented in very entertaining screenplay. The problem is in the second half, it is not matching with the first half...It has more sentiment scenes and the second half and complete climax block is so templated one. And it was bit uneasy to digest the climax, it looks so hurried one...
Bharathiraja and Nithya are so outstanding and definitely it is one of their best characters for Nithya....
I thought one VIP like fight in the second half, but they finished with quite believable way....
Lot of VIP shades we can see in this one... still it has its own moments to enjoy....

The story has lot of flaws, but it works big time because it is so relatable with its setting. The cinematography is unique with stand still emotions in focus rather than the drama.

Moviebuff_Chennai,21 August 2022,I felt a bored 133 mins,I didn't see as a neutral fan and so my review will not be apt for this movie...I felt bored almost all the time.Barathirajaa & Nithya Menon were the best performers. Nithya Menon was one step ahead.As usual Dhanush picked 3 heroines who were not part of his previous movies. He never pairs with the same face again even if the story demands.Songs were not repeating in my mind as I am not a fan of Dhanush voice. I still don't understand why he sings 3 songs in every movie. To my taste Dhanush spoiled a song in Jail movie. His base voice don't suit all places...Overall I felt bored and my personal opinion..,4/10,Thiruchitrambalam
cs_rahul_kumar,7 October 2022,A Wholesome Enjoyable Rom-Com With Dhanush and Nithya Menen !!!,"Mithran Jawahar's Thiruchitrambalam is a surprising film, especially as it comes in this phase of Dhanush's career where he's straddling Hollywood, Bollywood and Tamil cinema with overarching themes of social justice. It's an ordinary food delivery boy's story of friendship and love without major dramatic upheavals. His name - Thiruchitrambalam - is a mouthful but his nickname Pazham (fruit) is no better. In local parlance, a 'pazham' is someone who is a wuss, and Thiru wears the label with resignation.Most of Thiruchitrambalam is set in a middle class apartment building where the homes spill into each other, and one can hear conversations about whether the gas cylinder was delivered or not in the background. It is here that Thiru aka Pazham stays with his grandfather, Thiruchitrambalam senior (Bharathiraja), and policeman father Neelankandan (Prakash Raj). The three men from three different generations manage the home together. There is something broken about them, a tension in the house that never leaves. Mithran draws an effective portrait of a real, dysfunctional family with anger, frustration and a lot of humour too.In contrast to where Thiru lives are the swanky apartment buildings where he delivers food. Thiru's world is different from theirs; he accepts it without rancour. Dhanush is introduced minus fanfare. He's sleeping head down on his scooter, catching some rest between deliveries. He simply lifts his head and looks at the camera, and... that's it. It's Thiru we see on screen, and not the star. Dhanush has that amazing ability to melt into ordinariness despite his towering screen presence and charm. Few actors are capable of looking so vulnerable on screen after they've achieved a certain stature in their career. He makes it seem effortless.Bharathiraja is a delight as Thiruchitrambalam senior. He's funny, empathetic, frail, wise and irritating - just the kind of grandfather you'd expect in such a setting. How I wish we got to see more of Bharathiraja, the actor, in our movies! Prakash Raj has played the angry Appa in so many films that it's a marvel the man is still able to bring variations to the role. As the grouchy Neelakandan who struggles with bottled up guilt, he's every bit convincing.The heart of Thiruchitrambalam is the lovely Nithya Menen who plays Shobana. She's Thiru's bestie from the same building - the only one who actually calls him Thiru and not Pazham. Though I could see that the role was written by a man in the extra chirpiness that Shobana is forced to carry, Nithya's natural ease on screen makes her adorable rather than annoying. It's also a good idea to make Shobana Telugu instead of Tamil; it makes the casting choice work better. Shobana speaks Telugu to her parents but Tamil to her brother, reflecting the linguistic equations in many homes where people are multilingual. It's a small detail that shows the attention paid to structuring the characters.Anirudh's background score complements the subtle, unheroic tone of the film. The music director has made a name for himself for the adrenaline pumping scores of star vehicles, but in this film he shows that he can be restrained and mellow when needed. The picturisation of the beautiful 'Megham Karukatha' song brought back memories of 'Vennilave Vennilave' from Minsara Kanavu.Though the genre is romcom, there is very little cinematic romance in Thiruchitrambalam. People do go to airports and traverse continents, but they don't get on an international flight at the drop of a hat with an instant visa in their passport. Also, there are no guitars involved. What a relief to see such a simple, well-told story in Tamil cinema after so long! Nourishing and no fuss, just like a pazham.",10/10,Thiruchitrambalam
naveen_reloaded,27 August 2022,Nithya Menon all the way,"A wonderful movie after a long time. Kind of feel good one too. Nithya Menon stole the show right from the start. Take her out of this movie , there is nothing much left. She just oozes with love and naughtiness throughout the movie. The chemistry between Dhanush and Nithya Menon looked so natural.Dhanush played his part well , but i felt too much monotonous expression from him off late. Bharathi Raja has done a spendid job. The ""Megam Karukatha"" song is wonderfully choreographed. The colors , the dance ... wonderful.Overall a very nice movie to watch as family.Nithya menon all the way.. She is simply too good...

chand-suhas,19 August 2022,VIP lite led by 4 terrific performers.,"Mithran Jawahar & Dhanush re-unite to make a simple film which isn't a remake yet follows the template of VIP, another Dhanush film. Despite that, it succeeds to have it's own identity thanks to the world Mithran creates through his writing, especially the 4 main characters who leave a strong mark. Casting strong performers is another masterstroke. Dhanush brings in his innocent side with unresolved daddy issues perfectly. Bharathiraja as the grandfather gets the right amount of emotional scenes to excel whereas Prakash Raj proves yet again why he is among the best. But the real star of this film is Nithya Menen who just speaks with her eyes throughout, what an actress!Mithran has come up with a simple story which is carefully built up, revolving the story entirely around the main 4 characters. As predictable the story gets, the tightly written characters ensure their arcs balance the intrigue throughout. The other two actresses do suffer from convenient writing but there isn't much to complain as one is immersed completely in the lives of Thiru & Shobhana. Even the one customary fight sequence is designed superbly without compromising on the writing. I simply loved how this fight scene is utilized in showing Dhanush fighting his fears than the baddie.It's a slice of life romantic comedy, that delivers from start to end.",7/10,Thiruchitrambalam
TharsheyN,7 October 2022,"A Heartwarming Story Of Love, Tragedy & More!","Thiruchitrambalam is a movie with a lot of heart to it, it has a lovely romance arc to it with Thiru being oblivious to the pure, untainted love and affection that his best friend Shobana holds for him, while hopelessly chasing every other pretty girl that crosses his path.It's kind of sad to see at times, Shobana may not be as beautiful as the other girls his after but she truly loves him, not for money or fame but for who he is, she loves him for him, flaws and all. Unfortunately Thiru is blind to what's right in front of him and it takes him over 10 years plus his grandfather to make him see it. That combined with the tragic story surrounding Thiru's family and the way he tries to navigate life with his father who he has basically disowned and grandfather whose trying to hold the family together, makes for a interesting 2 hours.This is the first time I'm seeing actor Dhanush but he does an outstanding job at embodying who his character is, the same can be said for Nithya Menen who plays Shobana. Lovely acting from the both of them and supported by Bharathiraja who plays Thiru's grandfather and namesake you are left with a very balanced and talented all round cast.The music is pretty nice, though may take a few listens to get me hooked. Still a very nice movie, that I really enjoyed. I'll definitely be checking out a sequel if one if made as well as other works by lead pair Dhanush and Nithya.A very well deserved 9/10 from me, A lovely movie for all ages, has subtitles for those who don't speak Tamil(Like me, besides being Tamil), and will definitely leave you wanting more or at least discussing the film with your friends and family.Edit 1: I'm back to say the music has gotten me hooked, didn't take long either xD.",9/10,Thiruchitrambalam
nallaiah,3 September 2022,Heart melting Pazham,"A classic heart warming touch from director as well D
They once again proved that their combo works with feelings that melts the heart and along that Anirudh music it had taken away everything while watching..
Nithya she nailed it and gave that pure love in her eyes and acting.. especially the climax the way both loves expressed was a cliche of emotions packed in a small sized atom which burst along with the tears of audience at the end. Bharathiraja- dialog delivery and explanation for the present generation..he mastered it
Praskash Raj - a perfect father emotions and as usual massive actingOverall - a bunch of emotions and feelings giving a warm ful and pleasant experience..
a masterpiece in everyone career those who acted.

cerelacholmes,8 September 2022,Tamil cinema should make more slice of life/ feel good films,"Rating : 8/10Positives :1. Cast did their job very well and Dhanush aces his relatable , literally me middle class role again. But the show stealer were Bharathi Raja and Nithya Menon
2. Background score and songs ( except Thaaikelavi ) were so good and cinematography was on point.3. Writing was good ( special credits to Dialogues ). Also writing a feel good drama isn't everyone's cup of tea but Mithran did a great jobNegatives :1. Scenes related to PBS and Raashi could've been written well
2. Thaaikelavi felt out of place and even if it was cut, the pacing would not have been affected.Overall Thiruchitrambalam is a refreshing and great feel good drama that Tamil cinema misses right now. Directors should make more and more non cringey relatable content.",8/10,Thiruchitrambalam
sathyaaero,19 August 2022,Thiruchitrambalam will definitely attracts you.,"Thiruchitrambalam, working as a full time food delivery guy. He lives in his house with his father, with whom he has a hatred relationship and has a close relationship with his grandfather and also he sees Shobana, his childhood friend as an important part of his life who lives downstairs. It is his custom to share all his joys and sorrows with her.Dhanush, Nithya menen, Rashi khanna, Bharathi Raja and prakash Raj performed really superb. Especially Nithya Menen and Bharathi Raja gave an absolute good performance. Dhanush as usual performed well but Nithya steals the show.Although the story is modest, the screenplay saves it. The film follows with realistic backdrop and life of a character. This reality fitted well in screenplay and will not leaves the audience from getting bored.Also all the characters were built strong.And a question of what's a man's real love over women' will follows in audience mind throughout the film. Though there are strong elements in screenplay, the director followed some cliches in this film which makes the screenplay little weak.Anirudh's music was in ok level. Songs were good but same back ground music repeatedly follows throughout the film. Cinematography mades feel fresh and adds richness. The editing was good and helped the film to be sharp and sweet.Definitely a worth watch. Undoubtedly a good film.",7/10,Thiruchitrambalam
rajvignesh-60140,10 September 2022,The best of dhanush and nithya menon,"The best tamil movie in the recent times, its not the life of pazham , its more than a life of myself , i just watched myself in the screen, the clarity in love and respect to elders became a concern after watching this film, i literally weeped for a hour for the father scene and oh boy damn seriously its the film of me , dhanush oh boy you just raised my respect way too high for u , the best actor that tamil cinema has given the best performance and nithya menon oh my bubbly doll, she just nailed it with her performance, she need to do more films in tamil, bharathiraja oh boy he is still young , the counters and sentiments he is showcasing worldclass the best character ever in this film and as usual prakash raj killed it with the broken arm, overall a best family rom com movie, you will feel the life of pazham as a part of everyones life , PS i literally asked my father for wat i did in the past, after watching the movie, tat intense the movie , thiruchitrambalam a pure hit.

LordOfAvernus27,3 September 2022,Painful to watch,"One of the worst movies of all time. It seems like a 4 year old child was given a pen and paper and told to write a script for a movie. And this is the movie that was created from that script. My grandmother could have written a better story. Feel bad that Dhanush and the other talented actors and actresses were made to star in such a boring and loathsome movie. The writer of this movie needs to watch real movies with real stories like Soorarai potru, Doctor and Fir. I really want to end my review here but I can't unless it contains at least 600 characters so I'll keep going on until it does. Oh yea, feel really awful that such a talented actor like Prakash Raj was made to star in this awful filth of a movie.

Mangalassery_Neelakandan,6 September 2022,Wonderful,"Let me say this first this is a clich√© movie but not let that fool you. Within the first 20 minutes we know how the movie is going to go, but they have presented the movie in a way that keeps us entertained through out. By the end we will fall in love with Nithya's character. The chemistry between Dhanush and Nithya is exceptional that they make us feel like we should also have a friendship like theirs.It is like a feelgood type of story that deals with Dhanush leading a life of a normal food delivery boy, Nithya being his childhood friend. Dhanush ""Pazham"" lives with his father and grandfather, while Nithya lives with her Father, Mother and brother. Then we are taken through how they lead their daily life, their friendship, value of relationships, and the climax wraps it all up in a happily ever after manner.It is a must watch for all because it is wonderful in its own way.

mailtosunilreddy,23 August 2022,some timepass movie,"Its a MM. Ie Mokka Movie. The usual unnecessary hype was too much for this movie. What a waste of 2.5hrs and rs.100. Put together some story bits from here and there to make a movie somehow to get claps & whistles from north madras audience. I mean showing as to disrespect elders at home is not some casual entertainment. Unfit actors in characters doing something and more pathetically pretending in some amateur roles. Storyless story, jokeless jokes, dialogueless dialogues etc are the real nature of this movie. And the songs, we dont know why there are songs. One main character in the beginning was completely out of story as if she dropped out.Doctor explaining the disease in medical words, using english to a villager etc all show the dialogue writing incapability. Anything thrown to the audience with lead actors and the audience will love it, seems the overconfidence motto of the movie making these days and this is one such example.We wont be surprised if the next dumb movie from the same overconfidence team called tiruchirapalli with the main character called as palli!",2/10,Thiruchitrambalam

Looks like Tamil industry missed bharathiraja acting for long time.I rener watching some movie with the same movie line, not sure if it was in malayalam.

jsataluri,3 September 2022,"Enjoyable, feel-good movie with Nithya Menen stealing the show once more","Thiruchitrambalam is an enjoyable feel-good movie from Dhanush, who floundered in Tamil after the duds of Jagame Thanthiram and Maaran, but gave a fantastic performance in the charming, but problematic Bollywood movie Atrangi Re. Mithran Jawahar delivers a simple, lifelike entertaining yarn of a movie which keeps you invested in the middle-class life of Thiruchitrambalam Jr aka Jr Pazham (Dhanush) and his relationships with his grandfather Thiruchitrambalam Sr aka Sr Pazham (Bharathiraja), estranged police inspector father Neelakandan (Prakash Raj) and his childhood best friend Shobana (Nithya Menen).The plot is predictable, but its heart is in the right place. The director keeps the charming mood going throughout and there aren't any dull moments. The music fits in well, especially the tracks ""Megham Karukkatha"" which has a nice 50s music and dance style to it and Kanneer Sindha sung by Vijay Yesudas.While Raashi Khanna and Priya Bhavani Shankar get the typical generic heroine roles as the failed love interests of Jr Pazham and don't have much to do, it is the chemistry between the lead 4 that makes this movie special. It's a cakewalk for Dhanush as he effortlessly plays the boy next door with a traumatic past. Bharathiraja is hilarious and amazing as the grandfather and Prakash Raj brings another dimension to his acting prowess as the guilt-ridden father. Stealing the show from all 3 male leads is an effervescent Nithya Menen who just lights up the screen whenever she's there. Her range of expressions are excellent throughout and you can't look away. As I mentioned in my earlier reviews of her movies, she is an original natural talent who will be remembered as one of the best actresses of her generation.Please do watch this movie!7.5/10.",8/10,Thiruchitrambalam

The film as so many comedy moments, with emotional moments that may make some people cry.We have missed these kind of nice romantic and family movies and I feel you always get these films from watching Dhanush.

There is nothing wrong with marrying one's best friend, but in a society like us this reinforces the notion that men and women can't be friends forever.This may not be a problem for 2K kids who does not care, but for 90s kids who would still have another 4 or 5 years of convincing the society that there can be true friendship with opposite gender.

Why girls have to be thyaagi everytime.. Will boys accept a girl who jollu uthifiinga behind handsome boys? Like heroin accept hero? Don't expect the same in real life. Always you guys will accept any thing a hero do but not heroine. See movie as movie don't expect a girl who accepts a boy even he is stalker, jollu uthifiinga behind beautiful girls.

thannyvishnu,25 September 2022,Kudos!,"So yes, in a few years this has to be one of the best feel good movies from Kollywood. First of all the story is well written. The movie has regular clich√©s and clich√© breaking scenes as well. But we won't notice it while watching the movie. The director has done his best to portray the emotions to the audience. Humor has handled in a nice way. Then Dhanush, yes he does it really good and we all know that. Expect the same in this movie, he won't disappoint you. But the stand out performer is Nitya menen. Thought her character would be sidelined, but it was her character which was highlight of the movie. Overall a good watch, nicely done by all the actors, a well made family entertainer.

abiaparna,17 October 2022,Worst movie ever watched,"First of all I need to appreciate Mr Dhanush for how he is being a role model for all youngsters in a wrong way. From the title of the movie to end of the movie he is the best example for how to treat elders in a very bad way , how to drink liquor daily with parents etc... And next come to story, I don't know how people are appreciating this type of movie which not even has a story. The only best part in this movie is only it's songs. He is the best man to destroy future generation with his behaviour in his most of the movies.Shobana is also the one who makes us to watch a movie for her. Otherwise If there is option for zero rating I wil give that.

it really sounds like a real story.The Music Sound Excellent it is Singing by the actor himself the film gives us a good message And tells us in addition about the delivery of meals and everyday life ""because of the small mistake in life it becomes what they are"" Like the mockery he can endure in life. Because of their work of embarrassing moments that can occur even when they are not at work is how the film wants to tell us we keep what we have and that we should not hope for more otherwise we will lose everything.

Prakash Raj underplayed but apt for the movie..
Anirudh music...should be turned as another character shouldering it through out.For Mithran this movie should be best in his list for next few years... characterization at best!Overall a breezy entertainer which hijacks you for 2+ hours and let you to travel along with Pazham and Shobana.

kirsingh-07598,26 September 2022,A love story to see if you have not watched one for Long!!!!,To start with I am not a great fan of Love Stories but due its cast I saw the same.The movie portrays a lot of emotions. Takes you to a place to show the importance of relationships in life. Certainly there is a take for everyone in this move. It could be a show of family bonding or showcasing the importance of close people in our lives.Coming to the acting part all the characters have done a great job. A special mention of Nithya Menen's work is a sure must.There is no much to be mentioned about the songs since the same does not add much to the story. Some moments do get a tear or two. These are movies which needs no much of guessing but the story goes real smooth. It is a must watch movie if you value emotional bonding.Overall its like seeing a common man or yourself into the mirror at some specific point in time.,9/10,Thiruchitrambalam
sumathyramesh-92949,25 October 2022,and ten out of ten for megam karukkada penne penne,"Text: A very beautiful expression of friendship, as Dhanush explores his encounter with an old flame opening himslef up to his trusted friend Nithya Menon, isolating the respite he experienced from his parched outlook on his own life, shedding his burden, so beautifully as mannai thooral theendum munne vasam parkiren- gentlest of pleasures nature bestows on arid land, anyone who is human can feel. The refreshing choreography, the absolutely balanced music and the softest of lighting worked wonders, all understated lest they hurt the rain drop descending in Dhanush's heart. Another one for the ages...

abishiekm,20 August 2022,Such a great entertainer and a feel good movie!,"Watched Thiruchitrambalam today and I can surely say this is among the best movies released in 2022 so far. I kept my expectations very low even after hearing the positive reviews. And yes, I was wrong. A great movie to watch with your family. The blend of comedy and emotions were really great. Stars like Dhanush, Prakash Raj and Bharathiraja have anchored the movie so well! And not to forget about Nithya Menen, she also did a great job and she was very perfect in whatever role she was given. Do watch it in theatres this weekend with your family!

lhavanyamurali,23 August 2022,A movie that just coasts along with no real point,"Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? I really wanted to like this film but I didn't. I felt it was just coasting along with no real point. And, I honestly didn't enjoy Nitya Menon and Dhanush's friendship. I felt like it was trying way too hard to be this amazing connection. I guess I went in with too high expectations. I'm sad it didn't work for me.

Is a perfect example of how good casting can elevate the movie. Tamil audiences really miss this kind of light hearted family Friendly movies. Kudos to dhanush for selecting scripts like this even after becoming a big star. He definitely understands these are the kinda movie that make a star. Nithya menon is going to rake up awards for sure. Well deserved one.I can understand that 2k kids may not like this movie.

harishnth,11 September 2022,Feel Good Movie.,"Simple and Pleasant movie to watch without any second thought. Nithya Menon's acting was the top notch of this Film. Bharathi Raja acting was absolutely elegant to watch. D as usual his natural acting continuously flows in this film without any doubt that he's also an icon of Tamil cinema like Super Star and Ulaganaayagan. Prakash Raj fits excellently for this role and he's gem in any role where ever he's given a role. Again I'm saying this is a normal story with basic things happening in normal day to day life of an Normal man. It can connects easily with B & C centre Audience. Finally Anirudh music oh god whichever film he composes it's a massive musical hit either it's an big budget or small budget. 3 songs in this film is elevate the rating of this Film to the next level.

The movie has every clich√© written the book of cinema but when you have a star cast who shine, sparkle and compliment each other. Your cinematic experience becomes relaxing.Dhanush plays Thiruchitrambalam who is named after his Grandfather played by the super cool Bharatiraja. Prakash Raj plays his father. The entire grandfather-father- son relationship is handled so well. Nithya Menon is such a charmer, she brings so much positivity on the screen, she brings the life and joy in this movie.Dhanush as a common man brilliant in this one, his dramatic scenes with Prakash Raj are top notch. The music is excellent and it was a great cinematic experience.Charming movies work.

jatinschhabriya,27 August 2022,Wholesome entertainer with powerful lead performances,"Thiruchitrambalam is a slice of life rom-com about a middle class delivery boy from humble means who has a tiff with his father and blames him for the loss of his mother, yet lives under the same roof to look after their common father, who is the care-taker of the family and also a cook. The story follows protagonists romantic interest with Anusha and Ranjani played by talented cast. Dhanush lives up to his performance delivery as a method actor and it is hard to deny a great elan as he sails through blunt breakups with both his interests.The predominant side of this film are small yet heartwarming scenes to depict the friendship between Pazham and Shobana, who appear to be siblings-slash-friends, Nithya Menon blends in as a independant and hardworking IT employee and completely wins us over with her quirky sense of humor and sarcastic blunt sided quarrels that seem very sisterly to Pazham. It's amazing how the lead actors speak three dialects with great ease and we also witness a very timid side of Dhanush through intermittent action sequences with a corrupt heistsman that showcases his versatality in fight sequences compared to other characters he has potrayed such as.the aggressive Sivasamy in Asuran. The film manages to be a light rom-com blending in just the right amount of variance in the pairing to introduce characterization without boring the audience as a typical cheesefest romance. Hihgly recommended to watch with friends or family.",8/10,Thiruchitrambalam

Nithya Menon had a stellar performance and was took over the movie. Bharithiraaja's one liners carried the movie. Prakash Raj played a great role as a paralyzed father. Dhanush, Nithya Menon, Bharathiraaja, and Prakash Raj all play their roles amazingly. Cinemotography was great, screenplay was great. One of the biggest positives for this movie is simply the background music by Anirudh. This is a great feel good family entertainer for all ages. We need more movies like these in the future.

newtech-42588,17 October 2022,Best Romantic drama in Tamil cinema industry,"Thiruchitrambalam Film Survey: With Thiruchitrambalam, Mithran Jawahar conveys a sweet-natured show in which he plays with recognizable figures of speech, however gives them a perfect proportion of newness to keep us contributed and ultimately leave the theater with a grin. In Dhanush and Nithya Menen, the chief has two entertainers who easily make their characters charming, which lifts the film's allure and makes it beguiling.The story rotates around Thiruchitrambalam (Dhanush) otherwise known as Pazham, a food conveyance fellow, and his connections. There is his granddad Thiruchitrambalam (Bharathirajaa), who is the mentor in his life, considering that his dad Neelankandan (Prakash Raj), a cop, and he are scarcely friendly, because of a misfortune from quite a while ago. There is Anusha (Raashi Khanna), his experience growing up crush, who strolls into his life after years and makes his heart shudder. And afterward, there is Shobana (Nithya Menen), his neighbor and cherished, lifelong companion, who is his one wellspring of solace. As Pazham says, ""Straightforward aana life. Perusa show edhuvum illa.""
The conditions that these characters have with one another aren't precisely new. We have the granddad as the mate saying in the connection between the two Pazhams; the unpleasant and-extreme dad with a delicate side in Neelankandan; the rich, fair beauty queen in Anusha; the best bud who is significantly more than simply a 'companion' in Shobana. We know how this large number of circular segments will end in the end. Indeed, even the characters understand a portion of this (Pazham himself lets Anusha know that their universes are unique). However, Mithran Jawahar guarantees that the scenes have sufficient newness so they don't appear to be prosaisms. One of the stunts that he utilizes is mindfulness, which he uses to prevent scenes from becoming tacky, and infuse humor. The profound minutes are not constrained fitted, yet advance in a natural way. Like how the showdown scene among Pazham and Neelankandan drives us to the flashback that explains to us why their relationship is broken. He then allows the entertainers to wrap up.One of the main joys this film offers us is watching these staggering entertainers take what are basically natural person types and imbue them with flesh through their exhibitions. Bharathirajaa loans gravitas to senior Pazham and makes you see a man who has carried on with his life, its ups and downs, and has decided to be content even inside a broken home. Prakash Raj makes Neelankandan compassionate without attempting to oversell the person's incapacity. In the scene in which he looks for absolution from his child, his face is completely out of concentration, however he actually causes us to sympathize with the person's aggravation and disappointment through his exchange conveyance. For Dhanush, the job is something he has done previously, in films like Yaaradi Nee Mohini and Velaiilla Pattadhari (whose DNA this film shares), however the entertainer actually figures out how to track down better approaches to play this kid nearby job. It is an extremely inward exhibition and in numerous scenes, he silently conveys his personality's sentiments with negligible motions... a teared-up eye, marginally trembling lips, a glare, etc. With respect to Nithya Menen, she is superb. She doesn't strain to make Shobana charming, yet makes her a loveable character. The shimmering eyes, the wide grins, the happy discourse... they all join to make this character a bright one that adjusts the dimness in Pazham's life. It's no big surprise that these entertainers make us put resources into Pazham's life consistently.There are not many bogus notes. A subplot including a hijacker (Trick Silva) is excessively strategically located to determine the hero's injury. We get an air terminal peak that is straight out of the 90s, yet fortunately, it gets a cutting edge turn that makes it pleasing. The exhibitions assist us with disregarding the irregularity in Dhanush's searches in scenes that occur around the same time (conveniently managed facial hair in a scene with Raashi by day transforms into a fairly messy one in the accompanying scene with Nithya Menen around evening time!). Maybe the main piece that sticks out is the diversion to the hero's town that doesn't actually add anything extra to the story. We get a couple of additional characters who are likewise decent individuals, and another young lady whom Pazham likes (Priya Bhavani Shankar, in a job that is a greater amount of a lengthy appearance). In any case, that is simply it.Thiruchitrambalam Movie Review: With Thiruchitrambalam, Mithran Jawahar delivers a sweet-natured drama in which he plays with familiar tropes, but presents them with just the right amount of freshness to keep us invested and eventually leave the theatre with a smile. In Dhanush and Nithya Menen, the director has two actors who effortlessly make their characters endearing, which elevates the film's appeal and makes it charming.The story revolves around Thiruchitrambalam (Dhanush) aka Pazham, a food delivery guy, and his relationships. There is his grandfather Thiruchitrambalam (Bharathirajaa), who is the father figure in his life, given that his father Neelankandan (Prakash Raj), a cop, and he are barely on speaking terms, due to a tragedy from their past. There is Anusha (Raashi Khanna), his childhood crush, who walks into his life after years and makes his heart flutter. And then, there is Shobana (Nithya Menen), his neighbour and childhood friend, who is his one source of comfort. As Pazham says, ""Simple aana life. Perusa drama edhuvum illa.""For more about this movie :",10/10,Thiruchitrambalam

samxxxul,10 June 2022,Everyone with a beating heart go see this!,"No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery, finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface. His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie. It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption, overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love. Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.To conclude ""777 Charlie"" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up ""The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug."" I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.",7/10,777 Charlie

The makers have successfully delivered an endearing and wonderful film. The film has stood up to all the expectations of the audience. The writing of the film is flawless, the emotional roller coaster ride gives you the perfect blend of emotions and drama.Rakshit Shetty has again given an impressive performance and he never disappoints his fans. His bonding with Charlie is a delight to watch. The female labrador Charlie's acts and her eyes will surely melt your heart. The cameos by Danish Sait and Bobby Simha will be loved by the viewers. Raj B. Shetty, Sangeetha Sringeri, and other supporting actors were fine in their roles.This is indeed A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug, which has been inspired by Dharmaraya's character of the Mahabharata where he reaches heaven alone and a dog follows him and he ensures the dog will go to heaven. The score and soundtrack of the film composed by Nobin Paul are refreshing. The direction, cinematography, editing, and screenplay, everything was perfect in the film.The movies like 777 Charlie come so rarely in our Indian film industry. It is undoubtedly a worth-watching tale of human-dog relationships.Movie Rating:

The director and team have done an excellent work to achive this. Nobody should miss watching this movie.,10/10,777 Charlie

Thanks to the director Mr. Kiranraj for bringing this masterpiece! Every actor played their role beautifully.. Especially Rakshit,the small girl,the Animal Welfare Lady and others.. Its Charlie who steals the show! I even cried to some moments.. Almost every one who has a pet dog can relate to this movie, atleast I can! I watched the Malayalam dub version, and to be honest, it was pretty good! Its just that naming the places according to the dubbing language makes me feel odd, like we know the movie is shot in Karnataka, but the names of places shown are of Kerala..

sudhakaranakhilan,12 June 2022,Man and Animal; love,"The Man-Animal relationship is something an important topic or subject for filmmakers because it is easy to build up so many emotional elements into it. Just remember the movies like Hatchi: A Dog's tale, A dog's purpose, etc we can find that kind of technique which makes the audience swirl into the depth of emotion even though the situation of pouring tears. I also belong to that category and shed tears while I finished Hatchi. 777 Charlie is similar to it, which leaves us from the theatre with wet eyes. Simply, the story of the movie relies on the relationship between Dharma (the protagonist) and Charlie (the other protagonist) with some top-notching emotional add-ups. How 'Keaton turned Charlie' came into the life of Dharma, who leads an untidy, lonely life, and how the influence of Charlie reshaped and revolve around his life, etc, are the main things that the movie discusses. Hats off to the wonderful performance of Charlie. He is the 'man (animal)' who stole everyone's heart. Along with Charlie, Rakshit Shetty also did his part brilliantly. Kiranraj, the director of the movie shaped everything from his own personal experience (he said so in an interview) and we can see the wholeness of the director in the film. He indirectly reflects his love for the legendary filmmaker Charlie Chaplin through he assigned that name to the protagonist. And also there is a slight director brilliance too in the movie where he named Keaton first to Charlie reflecting his love towards another filmmaker Buster Keaton. Directly or indirectly he just reveals his passion and admiration for the legends, both are comedians in the public domain but more than that when compared to their contribution to the film field. And I also noticed something in the film which looks comical in its aspect and that is the quote written on the waste bin near Dharma's house, the quote states that 'One man's trash is another man's treasure' and that quote remembers me another one that I heard on a film which also hit the theatres recently and that is 'One man's terrorism is another man's revolution. It was from Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie Vikram. Anyway, that remark was only for my satisfaction. Come back to the movie 777 Charlie, it is a beautifully executed saga of a Man and his pet.",7/10,777 Charlie

sakagadi,11 June 2022,The Tale of Charlie,"Every once in a while there comes a movie which takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. But 777 Charlie takes you on an airplane to the highest altitude possible and drops you right into the Abyss of emotions and you keep on falling in it for close to 3 hours.This one is soo damn brutal it'll make you weep an ocean, breaks your heart into thousand pieces and stitches it back only to smash it again.""We think too much and feel too little"" the movie took this quote of Chaplin and blended it beautifully with our mythology along with some great music and cinematography.The whole point of 777 Charlie is to make you feel something within yourself and bring out that lost human in you to survive this toxic world.PS: Stay through the mid-credits for some bonus content.",8/10,777 Charlie
arungeorge13,29 July 2022,Packed with almost everything you expect in a dog movie! [+63%],"777 Charlie is packed with all tropes of a light-hearted dog movie, including a tear-jerker climax. The first half is certainly more engaging as we wonder how an emotionless loner taps into his inner self and connects with a stray Labrador pup (the adorable Charlie), making him a more expressive-but-composed human being. These bits are also laced with situational humor and a sparkling Raj B Shetty extended cameo - a complete 180 from his vicious turn in Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana. While the bond between Charlie and Dharma is charming and full of warmth, it also moves into predictable territory in the second half. The dog competition parts did not feel essential to the plot whatsoever, and watered down the emotional core to some extent.The foreseeable finale is also stretched beyond all measure, especially since you've been readily waiting with a box of tissues for a good while. The writing in 777 Charlie also comes from a hardcore pet lover's perspective, and therefore, while the emotions hit sufficiently hard, there's only so many times you can go aww whenever Charlie spontaneously hugs Dharma. I did relish the texture attributed to Dharma (it's shown that he lost his family while he was still a child) and therefore, the journey he takes in the second half with Charlie makes sense as he never got to do something like that (with a loved one) before.",6/10,777 Charlie

shashwatblack,19 June 2022,"Few complaints, but definitely worth a watch","First, this is a refreshing take on Indian Cinema. I don't think anything like this has ever been created in mainstream Indian Cinema.Most of the movie follows the protagonist and their journey with their dog. The journey takes them through highs and lows; some very realistic situations but also some crazy coincidences that had no place in the story. Some things were done purely for fan-service, and I don't respect that. 80% of the movie is an excellent, top-notch portrayal of human-dog bonding. But the remaining 20% is cringy, mood-spoiling, insensible mess.Despite that, this is an excellent movie and definitely a must-watch.

umishra0622,12 June 2022,Just Pawsome ü§ó,"First of all i would like to tell that i have a labrador just like Charlie and the second thing is that I travelled almost 270 kilometres from AJMER TO JAIPUR (roundtrip) just to watch this movie and after watching it I can say that CHARLIE deserves it.This is not like just another movie like we all see daily in cinemas or our television where there is a guy who fights with the goons , shows his six pack abs, saves the girl, etc etc.... It's an emotion which dives in the pool of your heart the splashes of which you can definitely feel in your eyes.I don't know exactly that for how long I cried but i can definitely say that i cried a lot, even after watching the movie I wasn't been able to talk to somebody for atleast 2 hours.. You can just imagine the impact of the emotions which the creators tried to convey through this movie..
Kudos to Rakshit Shetty and the whole team FOR SHOWING US THAT INDIA CAN ALSO MAKE MARVEL and even with such a low budget and last but not the least Charlie üòò , what she did was amazing and i could easily say that even a hugely talented actor could not beat CHARLIE because what she showed us is EMOTIONS which is surely lacking in many of the so called Mass Entertainer movies which we regularly see nowadays

vishalgoswami-52185,14 December 2022,Excellent Movie,In starting it may seem little bit boring but when you reach to the film end it goes to another level & make you feel proud that you watched it. I can say this is a underated movie & we need more movies like this in india with different concept rather just of a girl and a boy love story. If i have to give little bit insight it is about a relationship between a dog and dog owner & how they create a strong bond overtime despite having different mindset & How it changes there perspective about the life they were living. Movie is worth watching even with full family you can watch this but only the risk is all may seem crying in the lastüôáüèª.,10/10,777 Charlie
nidhunmoviebuff,12 June 2022,A Soul-stirring adventure drama that will steal your heart!,"Kannada cinema might be known across India due to the Yash & Prashant Neel-led KGF franchise but in terms of pure content-driven high-concept film-making, the trio of Rakshit Shetty, Raj B Shetty, and Rishab Shetty are the true forces to be reckoned with. And now, after having already captured our imaginations with ""Kirik Party (2016)"" and ""Avane Srimannarayana (2019)"", in ""777 Charlie"", an adventure drama about the love between a man and his furry best friend, Rakshit Shetty has rendered another masterpiece in emotive, heartfelt filmmaking.The movie tells us the story of Dharma (Rakshit Shetty), a compulsive loner and misanthrope who seems to be spiraling down a path of self-destruction. Into his life comes Charlie the loveable runaway labrador dog and how their initially fractious relationship turns into an endearing lifelong bond forms the rest of the story. Rakshit Shetty is absolutely terrific as the morose, deeply damaged Dharma and steals your heart in the second half, especially in the emotionally charged scenes with his subtle performance.It is hard to imagine anybody not falling for the cuteness of Charlie the dog at first sight. The loveable white labrador is the heart and soul of the film and the trainers deserve all the praise in the world for how they make sure she immaculately performed in line with the narrative. Nobin Paul's music is uplifting and emotional in equal measure, supercharging an already gut-wrenching story. How man's best friend can take over one's whole world to fill the emptiness in our hearts is portrayed with conviction and a lot of soul by the makers.Director Kiranraj K and writers Raj B Shetty and Abhijit Mahesh are careful to avoid all the run-of-the-mill tropes usually associated with movies about pet love, going down radically different routes whenever you feel like the movie is becoming predictable. It is inexplicable how actor-writer-director Raj B Shetty is able to shift gears from the gory and violent ""Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana (2021)"" to writing this soulful adventure drama and also play a quirky, delightfully comic character in the same.After the soul-stirring ""Thangam"" short in ""Paava Kadhaigal"" (2020) and the Oscar-winning ""CODA (2021)"", ""777 Charlie"" is the only movie that had me reaching for the tissues in recent memory, such is the beautiful relationship between Dharma and Charlie. This is one movie to be experienced and not analyzed so I will stop myself here. Go watch it in theatres and I promise there won't be a dry eye in the hall. Highly, highly recommended!",8/10,777 Charlie
xabirhossain,11 June 2022,Masterpiece...,"A great masterpiece. Deserve Oscar nomination. I cried a lot after watching the movie. Once I had a pet dog. I know how much I cried when I lost her. Thanks to the ""777 Charlie"" team.

OnjiMooteDaMarle,19 August 2022,A Highly Emotional Roller Coaster Ride,"A well balanced movie in terms of once emotions. It's all hanky-panky and laughter till a point and then though it's got tragic times way ahead the story still has its moments of smiles. I loved the authenticity given to languages - when Dharma meets a Tamilian, the Tamilian speaks in Tamil itself with 'koncham' Kannada. It keeps the character true towards reality.As this film is really wonderful I'll be strict on it's shortcomings or the cons as they say. The biggest irritating thing in this film is Raj Shetty. His overacting, over the top Mangalorean dialect (Tuluvas in daily life don't talk like that, definitely not in cities) & pronunciations, body language and facial expressions are all the same in every film. He has never changed his character since OMK. His every scene in this film has been very irritating. He is also not in his character. His dialect changes when it's a serious scene later on. Sangeetha Sringeri's acting is slightly bland or should I say I don't know if she is being sarcastic every time she talks. Rakshith is quite OK though there are more glimpses of his characters from the past in terms of body language, yet he is digestible. The neighbours' characteristics are very conveniently written for the story's progress or for Dharma's character. They don't have any contribution to the major part of the film. The dog is simply brilliant.The film doesn't let us know the route Dharma takes to reach wherever he wants to nor do we know where his destination is. It would have been great to know his map, his route, his destination without which the journey is all over the place.There is a word used in one scene - 'andha' meaning blind. I have no clue why the hindi word was used while the characters were within Karnataka in that scene. It doesn't come in any characteristic of any character. They could have simply used the word 'kuruda'. It's a silly thing but it made me wide eyed for a moment.For all these reasons I removed one star but this is a true pan India film and it deserves to be shared with everyone. I have no dogs and never have I ever had one but films with dogs' journeys are simply wonderful! Watch this film at all cost.",9/10,777 Charlie
sdadsasdasdasdasdasd,13 June 2022,Rated 7 only because movie finished.,"Kiran Raj can direct movies much well. Though this can be compared to the bridge category of films in Malayalam, the movie could had been much entertaining.They've a message at the end of the movie. Still not equal to the hype that's created by the movie team on media. The film makers these days should stop falsly creating hype.Rakshit has acted well, can receive a award. The heroine is a totally fake character in the opposite.

suniloily,1 November 2022,Overhyped! Save your time,"Extremely overhyped movie. Most positive reviews comes from coastal Karnataka in which Rakshit shetty belong to. These people blindly praise and create exaggerated hype. Most Rakshit movies drags endlessly. Except first 30 minutes, movie drags like crazy. Story is incoherent, forced emotion, silly comedy, unrealistic sequences. Songs are placed here and there, none of song are impactful. Movie is kind of documentary. Even dog lovers get bored. Female actor following male actor so lame. Movie length could have reduced to 1 hours.. And what the hell is that dog competition part. Save your valuable time.

IPyaarCinema,18 August 2022,Emotional And Entertaining,"Portraying the 'Man-Animal' relationship in cinema is a tricky front. And tell a story filled with high emotions is even more complex. A very few have managed to crack the right proportion and it won't be an exaggeration to say that we might have found another addition to the list. 777 Charlie is a film about the bonds we form unknowingly and how they shape our lives.Director Kiranraj K succeeded in narrating a feel-good emotional story between a dog and a human. But, Kiranraj could have taken some more care in writing a crisp screenplay. The cinematography is good, especially in the climax. Nobin Paul makes many scenes elevate with his wonderful background score. Editing in the second half could have been better.The story is simple and even predictable sometimes, but Charlie makes it beautiful with its lovely performance, especially in emotional scenes. Besides, Rakshit Shetty justifies his role. His transformation from an arrogant person to an emotional one is shown well in the movie. The emotional scenes between Charlie and Rakshit Shetty worked out very well and everyone will connect to those scenes for sure. Sangeetha Sringeri's character could have been better. A few scenes in the latter half are illogical but passable.777 Charlie' is a treat for fans of both Rakshit Shetty and films that convey essential messages, such as pet adoption in this case. There is a lot of heart and soul in the movie.",7/10,777 Charlie
CultCriticMag,25 July 2022,Must watch!!!,"The movie was super entertaining and emotions were out of the world. Lessons to learn and it teaches how one must be empathetic in life.

AdityaShankar0901,27 June 2022,777 Charlie - Simple & Impactful,"777 Charlie - This movie is living proof that a movie can be good without complicated storyline, expensive production, and high octane action.Rating & Review:Story: 4/5 - Story was good, the only issue was that they could've given a bit more context. A little bit more if the story had details and subplots it'd have been perfect. But to each his own!Narration, Screenplay & Direction: 4/5 - Felt slow at times but most of the time it was good. Some scenes were unnecessary to the story (ex: the dog show scene)Production Values: 5/5 - Great! Considering the budget and need, the VFX was very good and promising.Others: 5/5 - No other issues.Total: 18/20 = 9/10Final Verdict: This movie is a light-hearted movie about dog-human relationships. If you're a dog lover, or even if you're not one, you might like this film.(I just hope there's a sequel, or maybe the next project of the director somehow connected to this film, it'll be nostalgic!)When I saw many pan-Indian films like KGF, RRR, etc., This one is good for a change.If you're looking for simple themed movies then this is one of the best. It is nothing short of 10/10 but the pacing was an issue.",9/10,777 Charlie
saru2020,13 September 2022,get to know the dog lover's life,"This film is a decent presentation of a dog lover's life with the protagonist's life being already messed up and how a dog's entry into his life changes the trajectory with lots of emotional sequences placed across the film, but somehow the content felt like old one where the dog is replaced by the heroine and I realised this when the story moved towards the dog having cancer, meh.One new thing that was presented was the psychology of the person who grows up a dog which was somewhat differently showcased.The film is made along the lines of Hachiko, so if you love that film, this is also a good watch.

bizzarebrajesh,21 June 2022,An experience you'll never forget.,"Whether you own a pet or not, you'll feel you own Charlie. Man, such movies are the ones which come rarely. Don't miss it.The acting especially by the dog, god promise I felt it. The eyes of dog did the magic. Everything else is just perfect the direction and I loved the soundtrack and cinematography most.The only thing I felt lack was the second half was too long and suddenly scenes are cut to another.

SoumikBanerjee25,29 July 2022,You will fall in love with Charlie!,"""A life of Love, not of Years""The film just ended a couple of moments ago and here I am, sitting in complete silence collecting my thoughts, pondering over the roller coaster ride that I had just come out of. It is quite tough for me to convey the exact feeling I am having right now this moment.The climax left me devastated, I could not control the perpetual gush of tears from my eyes, At first, I whimpered and then I started weeping like a baby and I kept on shedding my tears until the credits rolled! Can't remember the last time, I felt such powerful emotions getting a hold of both my body and my conscience!It doesn't matter if you're a pet owner or not, it doesn't matter if you love dogs or not, I would go as far as to say it doesn't matter even if you're someone who despises these wonderful animal beings; this is a film that has the power to melt anyone's heart!Before you even realize it, Charlie and Dharma will grow on you. You will start rooting for them in every step they take, you will have the biggest smile seeing them happy and will subsequently be heartbroken when they will be separated.Do not miss this ride at any cost! You have my word, you are going to experience something indescribable, I assure you, this is one film that you will never gonna forget, you won't let it go away.",9/10,777 Charlie

m-ramanan,1 August 2022,"No Hollywood Pet cliche, but filled with Indian cliches","RATED 7/10
Language: Kannada
Media Partner: VootGood family friendly movie... One of the best Pet movie made in Indian cinema. They got rid of all Hollywood cliche of Pet movies and stuck in Indian cinema cliches...The movie was too good in first half and enjoyable till the dog show. From the dog show till climax it was full of templated episodes...
The biggest problem in this movie is they put dog in the place of heroine and followed the same old disease template...
The climax on the temple was so touching and the dog was too good. She was trained so well...
One time watchable with family and kids. After they kids might get strong will to adopt pets :)

Biswas_,27 August 2022,Makes you cry genuinely! Makes you love your life !,"I watched this film twice on OTT and it was really hard to control my tears in this film. The dog show sequence and the climax nearly made my eyes burst into tears üò≠. The makers have done a terrific job in establishing the bond between Rakshit and Charlie.Charlie the dog can make anyone's heart melt like an icecream with his cute expressions. Who doesn't love seeing a dog smile and cry when he gets sad, Charlie demonstrates all these emotions beautifully. They made sure Charlie was not just a dog on the set but made her perform as well. Lot of effort must have gone into training her for this film.Rakshit Shetty does a good job in emotional scenes. The film is about his reliving of life hence it is his journey as well but what is most beautiful is the dog human relation brought out so well.Humor is there and it works perfectly.Songs are really good but there are just too many of them (one negative). Literally a song in the background in every 5 10 mins. I love the song that goes ""Bhasha pyaar ki"" which plays in the dog show sequence in the 2nd half which made me quite emotional but the place where everyone cried was the climax and how Charlie gives a thank you gesture before dying , that scene till now whenever I imagine i get tears in my eyes, weak hearted ones will already cry profusely.Another negative point would be the editing of this film. 2hrs 45 mins is too long for a film like this . In 2nd half, many scenes i felt could have been shortened. 2hrs 25 mins was enough for this film.Overall, if you have voot select and missed it in theatres, give it a watch you will fall in love with the film. Dog lovers are in for a treat.",10/10,777 Charlie

Go and see it, feel it, experience every moment. It's nothing short of sheer brilliance! Felt every emotion - humor, joy, guilt, sadness etc. The message is also wonderful for those who don't know much about dog care. I must admit I was in tears towards the end as it reminded me of my darling 'Sasha', when I lost her when I was young. I cried for long, never went to school for a week, but gathered the strength to move on when my Dad got home another pup.Thank you for making me so happy and touched!

Coming to the movie oh boy the movie is just a master piece whoever acted in this film wud have been a sure hit, an osm piece of work, i wonder how did the dog acted that much intensity shown very good and osm performances, a simple story with the intense and different screenplay not bored a bit only the last part i though which was dragged and was too sad , the lead did an amazing job, kudos to the director for a wonderful journey, i was in tears literally in one or two scenes. Just showcased how cheap we r and these creatures and far better than humans to be honest an osm animal movie with soulful speaking. Please do watch it available in voot.

manthaniitdav,17 July 2022,Honest review,"Well the movie is a masterpiece. This movie really stands out and should be upheld for oscar nomination. One more thing about it is ,though everyone won't agree but I liked it more than the likes of RRR, KGF , etc. I know they are totally different genre but that's my personal opinion. It's like I would prefer 3 idiots over prithviraj, bachhan pandey, gully boy, etc. Anyway I just hope The Film Federation of India doesn't repeat the mistake what it did in 2019 by submitting dumb movies like 'gully boy' instead of a masterpiece like ' Tumbbad'.

vikas-r-ravi,11 June 2022,Pet lovers' paradise,"Beautifully made, well crafted movie. True pet lovers will understand the emotional connect between the dog and the initially reluctant pet owner. Direction is on the mark. Could have used a better background score to touch the audience hearts much deeper. Apart from that no qualms about how the bond grows and develops to the climax.

I cried a lot of time when I was watching it's emotional scenes. My dog died this year , and I was feeling and remembering every moments spent with him. This movie should be in Oscar. The script, cinematography, Music and acting everything is perfect and superb. While watching this movie you will realise how cruel our society to stray dogs , who are roaming here and there for own and their puppies. This movie sent a strong and loveable message in the society to adopt stray dogs. Stray dogs needs home and food. Wanna watch this movie again and again.

A refreshing tale with perfect blend of love , relationship and emotions which will keep you at the edge of the seat and the movie also changes the stereotypical thinking of the fact that you can only be at the edge of your seat only in thriller or horror movies
Rakshit Shetty is the body of the movie , but the real soul of the movie is none other than the Charlie
Who perfectly balanced the screentime along with actions throughout the movie with him and thus making it's a lovable and refreshing tale if witness time and again without getting bored.

This movie made me cry in the last 20 minutes, after Avengers Endgame i have never cried for a movie. Still saw some idiots speaking negative for this movie, go to hell or get some sleep, creatures. I regret for myself that i missed this masterpiece in theatres. Rakshit Shetty's acting is cool, while Charlie is not acting he is actually living in this whole Movie, and a big salute to the trainer of Charlie, he deserves an award honestly, every pet lover can Watch this with 100% trust, even though it breaks your heart or makes you emotional. Not only pet lovers, but also everyone who, has no interest in pets also, a pure family entertainer.

This movie proves that content is definitely the king and that all successful films are not just gloss and glamour. It has substance. Its an emotional journey which needs to be watched. This is one of those movies which is good enough to be India's entry for any international film award ceremony. Overall it's a must watch.

Charlie is very well trained actress, performed well adding huge value to the well performed Rakshit Shetty.

sdboral100,25 August 2022,A movie with deep meaning,"777 Charlie is a very simple yet powerful movie with a deep meaning.This movie is all about two characters; Dharma & Charlie(the dog). Dharma, played by Rakshit Shetty is a lonely man who has nothing, absolute nothing. His parents & sister die in a car accident on a rainy day in his childhood. After this incident he becomes very much lonely. He is a welder in a factory. Everyone there maintains a distance from him in his worklace and society. His daily life is very disorganized. In the starting minutes director has shown his lifestyle with very minute details.Oneday a labrador puppy comes to his house somehow. But he doesn't like the puppy. So, he doesn't allow the puppy to stay here. But incidentally he keeps the puppy in his house. Charlie brings a change in Dharma's life and mentality. These parts has been shown with great care.Dharma gradully comes to know that charlie is suffering from cancer and has very limited time. So Dharma decides to fulfil charlie's wish to show her snow. How Dharma fulfills his decision that is the main plot in 2nd half.This film has everything whatever a viewer wants. This film has fun, comedy, emotiion, affection.Rakshit Shetty is awesome in the character of Dharma. He plays his character very realistically.Watching charlie is also a gift from the makers. Somehow they have managed to gift the viewers something exceptional.Sangita Sringeri as Devika ialsodelivers strong performance. She is damn beautiful.The little girl, Sharvari as Adrika is also an important character of the film.Good videography is seen in the film. Screenplay is also very powerful to convey the message through the film.Thank you team '777 Charlie'",9/10,777 Charlie
manish41711,16 December 2022,Started strong but became meh in the second half,"Movie started strong. Guy doesn't care much for others. The way he was almost forced to take care of the dog was nicely done. But latter part of the plot had some cringe acting. Specially the dog show part. How did he manage to jump so high? Just because? The Punjabi judge berating him felt really contrived and fake. And the forced placement of foreigners acting so surprised? Lol. The premise of taking the dog to enjoy in the snow? That part was also weird. How did he know that was all the dog wanted to do? All in all a good watch but I had higher hopes for the climax. The latter part of the movie felt flat.

dhananjaypaliwal-25832,17 June 2022,Emotional,"This movie is another example that no matter in which language the movie has been shot or if the cast is widely known in PAN India or not, if the story is good than Indian masses will definitely watch the movie no matter what.The movie's first half is packed with laughter and a little emotional sense and in the second half the movie takes a high hit emotional ride and ends with the sobbing eyes of everyone.

Many unique concept movies and I cant question his versatality.The dog is also one of the best actor in the movie. Didnt seemed like script.

I controlled my tears upto the last seen.But at the very end, I realized that it'd be DISRESPECTFUL if my TEARS ARE STOPPED in that NATURAL EMOTIONAL FEELING expressed by Dharma(the main character).

rajeevsj,5 September 2022,Amazing acting but lack of story,"Some part is directly copied from the movie THE DOG.(hotel blind scence). I dont know why Indian film writers copying all from English movies. End part is predictable as same scenes are found in hollywood.First part and last part amazing but middle part with heroine totally wasted and destroyed entire movie watching experience. Heroine is totally unnecessary there and it spoiled the bond between the dog and hero and changed into a lovestory. There is no heroine required, and she followed a dog and an unknown person only for a one dog and travelled with him (I wonder how many dogs she followed till now, or only that particular person) without taking action against him. Which is totally unbelievable. Please make a movie without include hollywood copy and lovestory then show the love between dogs and human.Dog and Hero acted very well which is really commendable.",6/10,777 Charlie

info-namdev,14 June 2022,Finest Romantic movie in a long time.,"It had been a long time since i saw any quality movie with finest romance and may be that vacuum has got my feelings to like this more than it deserves (may be). We have scenes varied versions of romantic movies and here is a special one where in one partner can not speak the way human speaks but can very well speak the language of love because Love is an universal language does not any special tool to express it except for yourself. Love has been so effectively shown that any routine romantic movie may not be able to showcase it even with spoken words.777 Charlie, it is a great cinematic experience in its own pace (slow at times) showing different emotional settings of a human being through few specific scenes. Charlie who is a new comer has delivered a performance which is unparalleled, Rakshit Shetty is great as always, Background Score has absolutely matching every scene filled with emotions along with absolutely simple yet effective cinematography. Other characters who are part of the movie had very limited role to play however everyone has lived upto the expectation. Overall a good movie filled with loads of emotions and leaves many questions open in one's mind to think for the self about love, hope and respect.Charlie Rocks.Love , Respect, Empathy, Humility are beyond spoken languages because of its universality and here is a masterpiece taking you to the world of Charlie in special way.",9/10,777 Charlie

I mean i literally didn't wanted this movie to end, so epic, emotional, and good thing is strong message to society about the stray dogs. I could have cut 1 star for the start of the movie bit slow though but make up after that and leave no reason to cut any mark. Spotless performance by the leading actor and On screen Charlie was always adorable to watch. There are some emotional scenes in the movie specially if you ever had a dog in your life. This movie is worth to watch i regret i missed in theatre because that wasn't released here in where i am living in abroad.

M_D_V,25 June 2022,Emotional Ride Guaranteed.,"First thought after watching the 777 Charlie trailer was I wanted to watch this film in theatre at least for Journey episode and to see the love bond between Dharma & Charlie. After watching This film in Theatre I need to share some of my thoughts about this Emotional ride.Basic main plot is that when Charlie enters Life of a person named Dharma who was an introvert apathetic, how it changes his life and makes him to realize how Beautiful life is .We as normal audience can see how he one himself changes by his Charlie.Even Though I myself not a pet lover, I was able to feel the Diff emotions of Dharma throughout the film.A character Rakshith shetty played as apathetic ,antisocial and more of like Introvert due to his past. He convince us in every Scene with his Great performance.Even though i didn't liked the way Director chosen his past scenes to show us about is darkness in his life. Other than that Everything in the first half was clean and fresh. I personally connected to his early stage of the film. Major first half was all about dharma's resistance towards external world and how he gets bond with charlie and why?. The reason why he transforms from lonely person to loveable from Charie and that small kid was superb. Raj B. Shetty as Dr. Ashwin Kumar was hilarious , he makes us smile whenever he comes to the screen. Sangeetha Sringeri as Devika was good in her role. The film starts to make us emotional towards the end of it's First half. Definitely these two ppl steals our heart in the first half One is Bhargavi Narayan Mam & child actor Sharvari as Adrika with their innocence. Adrika character was so cute she brings cuteness to the screen with her smile & voice. First half ends with positive note.Second half is about Dharma's journey, his struggles to achieve for what Charlie wish for.This half makes us to enjoy the journey with them and later the stage makes to fall some drop of tears from our eyes that too especially with two-three scenes, how much one try not to cry still without our knowledge we would be more emotional. Personally didn't feel any lag in this half. Some felt Bhamsi character & Dog show was not required because those were nothing to do with the film' core plot. I felt both those were actually needed bcz (when one trying to show Dharma-Charlie's journey , there will be highs and lows in their journey. At some point they will take some inspirations from characters which they encounter in their journey & at some point they teach us how Deep their Bond is) Some Scenes are not always there to Steps to achieve Their Final Destination rather it's about makes us to know their character better & to Emote us at another level. At the ending of the film by Dharma's Struggles , for sacrificing everything(literally everything at one stage his time, money at one point he ready to sacrifice himself) to achieve what he decided at the first place. Especially in climax the way he Brings the emotion to the scene made me surrender for acting. For me it was best the performance from him till date. This film will be remembered for so long in his film career. And what left me was about Bhargavi narayan Mam's role didn't got proper closure. There is more to tell about this Emotional journey which just can't put those feelings completely into words. One thing is sure is, this is Must watch film.With all my heart i want to Thank Director Kiranraj, for giving almost 3-4years for this to bring such a Beautiful Story to us, Rakshith shetty for giving such a performance & to back this up. Nobin Paul for giving us wonderful playlist(O'Ga, Sahapati and Journey songs were my favorite. Welcome to The fire took the scene to another level). And Cinematography by Aravind Kashyap gave colors to each scenes. Similarly the way Charlie says thank you to Dharma I would say Thankyou üôèüèª Charlie Team for Bringing to us. Some films need to win not just with Box-office numbers, but by reaching out to maximum audience and need to get appreciated for it's Experience which it gave to us in Theatre.

pvenukumar-12732,14 June 2022,"If you are lucky you will get to watch this film, only if you are lucky","The review which follows may be partial because i am a pet parent but i tried watching it as a movie because i didn't want to cry in front of my family and relatives. Looking at premier response i tot the movie is a sad movie but it made us laugh out of the seats, keep guessing and broke us especially my son who cried loud and wanted to get out but when I asked him let's go or to closed his eyes...he still watched. That should sum it up... It's what you need in life, every emotion is in there. Proud it's an Indian film, proud it's from kannada industry.

rulerdinkar,30 September 2022,ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOVIE,"One of the best movies out there which shouldn't be missed at any cost.The plot of the movie is one of its kind. Just when I thought creativity has reached its peak, the movie comes as a pleasant surprise and gives a breath of fresh air.Hats off to the director for creating a screenplay which doesn't get boring even for a second and you don't realise when 2 hours and 40 minutes pass by.I wish I knew about this gem of a movie earlier and could experience it in a cinema hall.Also it comes with its own set of life lessons which are easter eggs like the world is a selfish place and only uses you for self interest, true love comes from family only, one needs money to survive no matter what, etc
It has given attention to some fine details like gradual growth of hair in the second half (which you will know why it should be). Just shows the commitment of production team towards this project.Congratulations to the entire team for this masterpiece. Don't want to give any spoilers but this movie is an emotional rollercoaster and will surely make you humane by the end. If this doesn't deserve Oscar award, I don't know what does.P. S.- Rakshit Shetty's acting was phenomenal, and so was Charlie's. You two made the movie soulful.",10/10,777 Charlie
rmshylesh,14 June 2022,The movie is mind blowing,"What a direction. What a story.No words to say. Its a must watch for everyone. If you are a dog lover, take your handkerchief because you're gonna need it throughout the movie.The movie also gives a good message for everyone.

Entire Rakshit and Kiran team deserved each bit of success for everything they had done;
And special congratulations to Rakshit for producing the movie...Making videos will show how difficult was it to make the movie; Kiran's narration itself says that they deserved more.

Bit unconvincing plot line for the second half. But by far a well made film. Almost all actors including the dog win your heart.

Thanks to the director Mr. Kiranraj for bringing this masterpiece! Every actor played their role beautifully.. Especially Rakshit,the small girl,the Animal Welfare Lady and others.. Its Charlie who steals the show! I even cried to some moments.. Almost every one who has a pet dog can relate to this movie, atleast I can! I watched the Malayalam dub version, and to be honest, it was pretty good! Its just that naming the places according to the dubbing language makes me feel odd, like we know the movie is shot in Karnataka, but the names of places shown are of Kerala..

I cried from my heart.I am afraid of animals in real life but i still connect with the charle and dharma bond. And how dharma fall for charle and how charle take care of dharma.Everyone should watch it because its not a movie its a masterpiece that no one should ever miss.I dare you that you will not stop yourself to love or feel for charle and dharma. And you will start crying from the second half and it continues to end. Its a emotional movie and can't be explain in words. You have to watch it to experience it.In short its a one those movies which i will remember always.,10/10,777 Charlie

ghanshanichirag,27 February 2022,Alia just rocked it.!!! slb is a legend. Ignore useless amateur hate mongers,"This movie doesn't deserve 5 stars . It's a 10 on 10 . Alia Bhatt ,Vijay raz ,Ajay Devgn everyone just shines and Excel beautifully . I have always loved Alia's growth as an actor and she is one of the best we have . Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a maestro and he prooves it again. He beautifully paints the movie .I wish the people of this country grow up and get some brain and stop spreading unnecessary hate.

bostonct,4 March 2022,Surprised by how good this movie is....,"This is only the 2nd subtitled movie I've watched from India (1st one Badhaai Do) and I'm pleasantly surprised by the tough storyline of this movie and all the actor's emotional performances to help tell the story. To be honest, the inclusion of a little song and dance in such a harsh subject movie is a bit new to me but it was still a very good movie to see even subtitled. For those that have not seen any Indian movies, go see this one. It's well done. You may want to sit up a little closer to read the subtitles easier. I will be keeping my eye out for other movies from India.

mayankshukla1404,27 February 2022,A powerful drama!,"The journey of Gangubai Kathiawadi was definitely worth a trip to cinemas after two long years. Alia Bhatt delivers a powerful performance and her finest yet. This goes on to say a lot considering the quality of work she has done so far. Ajay Devgn has such a solid screen presence. Inspite of having limited time he steals every scene he is in. The film has Sanjay Leela Bhansali's stamp all over it. The powerful drama, cinematography, sets, costumes, dialogues all quintessential Bhansali.

thefijispider,25 February 2022,Its all about Alia,"At first you wonder whether Alia can do this role. This isn't her comfort zone. But she definitely delivers. The cute, girl next door role is traded for a mesmerising controlling role of Gangubai and she owns it. Excellent visual appeal, as you expect from a Sanjay Leela Bansali movie. The music is outstanding throughout. Dholida makes you fall in love with solo garba, and Alia's performance in that song is jaw dropping. Worth waiting for. Her final speech where she sits and delivers to an audience is Amtiabh Bachchan-esque. Ajay Devgan is brilliant albeit a cameo role. Worth a watch to see how well Alia delivers the Mafia Queen role!

Movies like these although quite good,have absolutely no repeat value whatsover. In other words after 5 or 10 years this motion picture is definitely not one you will ever want to watch again. Once is definitely enough!7/10.

nidhunmoviebuff,28 April 2022,Alia is staggering in this poignantly inspiring biopic,"Alia Bhatt has already shown us her immense range right from the coming-of-age drama ""Highway (2014)"" to the pioneering ""Raazi (2018)"" but perhaps no other role has shown us her full scale of talent as Sanjay Leela Bhansali's visually extravagant and poignantly hard-hitting ""Gangubhai Kathiawadi"", out now on Netflix. In clearly her career-best performance, Alia moves from innocent to despondent and finally charismatically enterprising with such ease that the audience is left in pure awe.Based on the true story of Gangubhai Harjeevandas Kathiyawadi, a brothel madam of Mumbai's infamous Kamathipura red-light district in the 1960s, who takes up the welfare of her fellow prostitutes and the right to education of their children as her life mission. Inspired from anecdotes of her life as per the 2011 book ""Mafia Queens of Mumbai"" written by Hussain Zaidi, Bhansali adds his own typically vibrant embellishments to create an eye-catching world full of glamour, heartbreak, lust, thirst for power and ultimately, redemption.We follow the journey of the eponymous Gangubhai right from her being sucked into a life of prostitution after having arrived in Mumbai as a young girl with dreams of becoming a heroine. Her arduous journey from there to rising up the ranks to become the most influential power broker in Mumbai becomes a story we can invest heavily in, thanks to Alia's powerful performance that is both fierce and empowering ass well as oddly poignant and gutwrenching. Her romance with ""Ahfsaan"" (played by an excellent Shantanu Maheshwari) is eerily captivating and accentuated by the excellent music by the director himself. Every song sequence in the film stands out with the soul-stirring musical renditions, backed up by the eclectic dance choreography of National Award-winner Kruti Ramesh, especially the powerful ""Dholida"".Having had her impactful sequences mercilessly edited out from SS Rajamouli's ""RRR"", it is perhaps fitting that Alia Bhatt towers over her male co-stars in ""Gangubhai"", with both Vijay Raaz's ""Raziabhai"" and Jim Sarbh's ""Hamid Fezi"" coming across as half-baked, bit-part roles that are never fully fleshed out. Ajay Devgn recaptures the same fervour with which he had immortalized gangster characters inspired by real-life dons, first in ""Company (2002)"" where he played a role based on Dawood Ibrahim himself and then later in ""Once Upon a Time in Mumbai (2010)"" where his character was modelled on Haji Mastan. As ""Rahim Lala"" (based on Karim Lala) in Gangubhai, Devgn oozes gravitas and mass despite it being just an extended cameo, so much so that one wishes Bhansali will make a full-fledged spinoff film based on the character!Sanjay Leela Bhansali's maximalist style of filmmaking often overshadows the acting efforts of its leads but this is one movie that breaks the norm with Alia Bhatt's staggering performance standing tall against the typically jaw-dropping Bhansali sets and elaborately choreographed musical sequences. An immense portrayal from the actress who draws unnecessary flak purely for being from a film dynasty, this is one of the top female performances of 2022, right up there with Shefali Shah and Vidya Balan in ""Jalsa"" and Sakshi Tanwar in ""Mai"". Highly recommended!",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi
viskies,25 February 2022,Stellar cast in a period movie,"There are times when you think the scene is a bit too big for Alia to pull off, but her growth as an actor shines through as she does a damn good job of carrying the movie through.

SAMTHEBESTEST,24 February 2022,SLB's unconventional attempt to glorify infamous Gangubai is made watchable by Alia Bhatt's phenomenal act and Ajay Devgn's blasting cameo.,"Gangubai Kathiawadi (2022) :
Movie Review -Rewinding those great films made over the years about a prostitute's character, one of the earliest classics I remember is 'Shen Nu' / 'The Goddess' (1934), made by Chinese filmmaker Wu Yonggang. That was the heartbreaking story of a mother who had to abandon her son so that he would never have to take taunts from people for being a prostitute's son. Then came Kenji Mizoguchi's 'The Life of Oharu' (1952), which was about the struggle of a prostitute and her drowning career after her beauty age is gone. The best film ever made about a prostitute's career came in 1957, when Italian Master Federico Fellini conferred with his Masterpiece 'Le notti di Cabiria' / 'Nights Of Cabiria'. For those who don't know, this was the film that took away the Oscar doll from 'Mother India'-quite possibly the most revered film in the history of Bollywood. Gulzar's poetic mind gave birth to 'Musam' (1975), in which Sharmila Tagore played a double role that brought her a National Award, and one of them was a prostitute's character. After this, Bollywood hasn't made any significant films based on a prostitute's story, probably because the content seemed socially damaging and defamatory. Sanjay Leela Bhansali planned Gangubai's biopic almost a decade ago, but somehow things didn't go as per plan. Now in 2022, even after 2 years of coma (pandemic), he finished his ambitious project with one of the finest young female actors available in Bollywood. Gangubai Kathiawadi is an ambitious film, and it shows the dedication of the filmmaker on screen, but the storyline is not at all universal-friendly. This glorified tale of infamous Gangubai doesn't look glorifying at all because it was never meant to appeal to a normal, sophisticated audience. Yes, it may please the specific chunk of the audience who might love the feminine power shown in the film, and the entire Kamathipura section can have it screened every Sunday. But the family audience and the mainstream sector of moviegoers will forget it in the very next moment 'The End' appears.The film is based on a chapter of Hussain Zaidi's book, 'Mafia Queens of Mumbai'. It's the story of Ganga Harjivandas, a simple Kathiawad girl who is sold by her boyfriend, and now has to embrace the ways of destiny and swing it in her favour. That simple, gentle Ganga becomes Rowdy Gangu, a prostutite as well as a mafia queen. Gangubai Kathiwadi shows her journey of how she begins working as a sex worker and, in no time, marks her own territory, becoming Gangubai. The film then follows her political ambitions to her meeting with India's Prime Minister to save the roofs of about 4,000 sex workers in Kamathipura.What are your top 3 Alia Bhatt performances? Well, you need to update the list because Gangubai Kathiawadi is going to enter the list with high weightage. Alia's accent, looks, attitude, transformation, dedication, everything is top notch here. Whether it was Highway's climax scene or Raazi's self-control scene, I have always loved seeing her in those tough and challenging scenes where she had to scream her stomach out, and believe it or not, in Gangubai Kathiawadi she has outdone those two films. Certainly her best performance to date, and, like many other actors, it appears in an SLB film! Gangubai Kathiawadi has got a phenomenal supporting cast. Whether it is the cute-looking Shantanu Maheshwari or the deadly-looking Vijay Raaz, whenever they appear on screen, they make sure that they leave a mark. Even Seema Pahwa, Chhaya Kadam and Indira Tiwari leave you wanting more. Ajay Devgn as Rahim Lala is lit in every single scene. He hardly has four scenes to his name, but what hysteria he creates! His stellar performance will leave his fans thirsty, and they may go to warn Bhansali, hold a candle march, or even riot in order to persuade him to do a solo on Karim Lala, aka Rahim Lala. He sets the screen on fire in every single appearance, as if he was born to play a gangster on screen. This is definitely a mini version of Sultan Mirza.Coming to the negatives, first of all, it's a deadly long narrative. It's almost 160 minutes long and you have nothing to see that you couldn't predict. It follows all those traditional features of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali product, with just one chance that it all happens inside Kamathipura. The dialogues have infused some life into this half-dead storyline, and how. Not only because they have rowdyism and abusive elements, but because they are fearless, reckless and powerful. Not a single woman or girl will leave the theatre without clapping atleast once in their entire viewing experience. Gangubai's feminism is brutally honest for sex workers, and if you don't like that, you have Rahim Lala's swag and honesty about always doing the right thing. No doubt, Sudeep Chatterjee's cinematography will have you spellbound. The canvas, the framework, displaying the naturalism of the sets and aspect ratio, he has done an amazing job there. SLB as a music director has remained underrated, undeservingly. But this time he hasn't reached the high standard he set for himself. 'Saiyaan' is an audio to look out for, whereas 'Dholida' and 'Jhoome Re' are visually appealing. None of the song leaves an indelible impression on you. The background score by two Balharas sounds impressive on one or two occasions, but otherwise nothing noticeable.What it lacks the most is an engaging screenplay and a gripping line-up of events. The marathon journey of Gangu never looks convincing because all the conflicts in her life end up without any strong results. Gangu becomes a Mafia queen, but do we see her in that chair? No. Gangu fights for the election, but what happens after that? We don't know. Gangu sacrifices her love - just like that, and do we have any proper follow-up for that? No. Gangu even sizzles on the magazine cover and gives a big, loud speech, but what does she get from it? Nothing. These questions will make you believe that Bhansali's craft is not cement-proof. For some reason, director Sanjay Leela Bhansali appears to have been missing something for quite some time. When he made prestigious stories, they were marked by controversies, and somehow he just couldn't surpass his cinematically best works like 'Black' (2005) and 'Guzarish' (2010). Gangubai Kathiawadi may not be as controversial as ""Ram Leela"" (2013), ""Bajirao Mastani"" (2015), or ""Padmaavat"" (2018), but it is a much lower standard and damaged story in comparison. Of course, those three films had strong source material, while Gangubai is a niche one. Despite that, he still carries it through, with lots of struggle, of course. This script couldn't have gotten a better execution, but does it have enough to offer? The answer is No. Moreover, it's not a film that the entire family can sit together and watch. Overall, an ambitious project with an Average outcome. Alia Bhatt's impeccable performance and Ajay Devgn's stellar cameo have somehow made it watchable. Watch it for them and nothing else.RATING - 5/10*",5/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi
m-divyaa,25 February 2022,Great acting by Alia. Superb movie,"Can't believe the ratings on IMDb. We all know everyone rating this movie low are Kanganas paid supporters. This movie deserves atleast 8. Great direction great acting by Alia. Alia has already proven her acting abilities in many movies. She has single handedly carried the movie on her shoulders. These days reviews and ratings are politically motivated. Even before the movie released people had given low ratings.

AJ9441,3 March 2022,Alia Bhatt is a phenomenon,"When it comes to Hindi cinema, Alia Bhatt is so far ahead of all the other actresses in her era. As Gangubai she completely steals the show and delivers an emotional and realistic performance.The movie in general is compelling with an interesting message about a taboo topic. As is usual with SLB movies, it is a visual treat.

Performances were really good from the lead cast. I would recommend everyone to give this movie a try but dont take your kids to it. It's not a family movie.

The movie is just glorifying a pimp and whole movie seems like shot in inverter light, music is pretty bad, WTF was background score, dholida song dance when you see it in theatre is pretty bad seems like forced garba with no joy, just giving one star for Ajay devgan.

koonalh,28 February 2022,Perfection,"Can't believe i was having second thoughts for just a moment after watching the reviews from Ssr bots. Alia bhatt act never felt forced throughout the movie and she was equally or i would say even better in this one then her previous best acting in movie Raazi which i guess was her career best performance till now. Sanjay leela bansali's direction, vision can't be matched. Direction, screenplay, music direction, everything was so on point. Lastly it was such a sensitive topic to be covered in a way that it is not turned into a vulgar piece of art and again Slb did the best, Thank you for this experience. Not a grand movie if compared to other movies of slb but didn't lack any quality.

nitsvirusboyz,26 February 2022,AVG Film,"A visual treat film will test your patience for nothing. The first half keeps you engaged with Alia's transformation from the innocent Ganga to feisty Gangu. Post-interval, the movie turns into a dragged political drama. The climax seems a bit incomplete and weak that lacks the required punch. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's promising writing with a mediocre outcome.The movie has an amazing star cast and each actor completely justifies their character. Alia Bhatt delivered an excellent performance. Although she was a misfit for this role but her hard work and dedication are visible, she completely gets into the character every time. Alia carried the whole film to her shoulder and her dialogue delivery was outstanding. Shantanu Maheshwari and Jim Sarbh have given a decent performance. Vijay Raaz's flawless performance, Ajay Devgn's compelling cameo, Indira Tiwari, and Seema Pahwa's impeccable act makes the strong supporting cast.Apart from the performance, the hard-hitting dialogues and superlative cinematography are other highlights of this movie. The music is a mixed bag. No one has expected this type of average music from Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

mohaniyer-69032,27 February 2022,"Dull, plodding movie","SLB must be the worst choice of filmmaker to make a movie on the gritty and sleazy underbelly of prostitution in Mumbai. A guy who is famous for the exceedingly lavish and pompous settings for his movies rather than any directorial abilities shouldn't be allowed near such topics with a barge-pole. The real individual on whom this movie is made was a non-glamourous, jaded prostitute/lady don in Mumbai's rather infamous Kamathipura. Bhansali has tried hard to glamourize the titular character by having her dance, pose and mouth flamboyant dialogues. Basically yet another poor attempt to make criminals look glamourous and fashionable.

msunando,27 February 2022,"Lonely, bruised, shunned, yet feisty and relentless for her cause","""Gangubai Kathiawadi"" is the gritty biopic of the Ganga, a chirpy, dreamy, and loving young girl who was sold off for flesh trade in Bombay and her eventual metamorphosis into Gangubai, the underworld mafia queen who worked relentlessly for the welfare and uplifting of the lives of the sex workers in Kamathipura. Written by and also part produced by S. Hussain Zaidi, this Sanjay Leela Bhansali magnum opus is mounted on an artistic, larger-than-life film with opulent production values and sanitised studio sets that are a hallmark of all SLB films.Ganga has to undergo severe trials and tribulations from an early age after being sold off by someone who she believed was faithful, including violence that left her ripped apart. But, she remains dogged in her ambition to legitimise prostitution and bring dignity to the oldest profession in the world whilst relentlessly working for the uplifting of the community of sex workers. She finds support to her cause in Rahim Lala, the then powerful underworld mafia king in Bombay, and an earnest journalist, Fezi, who give her the shot in the arm, but she also has her share of detractors including the very society that the profession operates in and her peer group leaders.Sanjay Leela Bhansali treats the subject with silk gloves and weaves almost a poetic fabric to the real-life character of Gangubai without resorting to commercial distractions. Although the sets appear spotless and sanitised, and verbal communication remains hugely civil, the film doesn't fail to showcase the multitude of the emotional journey of Gangubai from the young Ganga to the matriarch she grew into, much revered by her coworkers and peers who recognised her selfless efforts. Alas, the duel between Gangu (Alia Bhatt) and Raziabai (Vijay Raaz), slowly turning into a finger licking war, was aborted prematurely, and we could have done with a little more of. Instead, SLB took long to portray the romantic interlude in her adult life that showed her vulnerable, soft corner of her character, and this aspect slowed down the film midway. No harm done, though!Alia Bhatt just nails it in the titular role. She combines all her skills of the craft into the labyrinth of Gangubai's character and us reminiscent of what once Madhuri Dixit had set out. She establishes herself as a multifaceted talent that can take on many more challenging roles. Ajay Devgn is brief, poised, powerful, and sophisticated. Shantanu Maheshwari is shy and pleasant. Jim Sarbh as the journalist, is perfect. But two performances must receive a special mention of - Vijay Raaz as Raziabai was terrific and menacing, and Seema Pahwa as Sheila Masi was a hoot! This SLB venture helped turn a subject like prostitution and sex trade into an immensely watchable family drama, yet didn't fall short of going the whole nine yards.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Amyth47,27 February 2022,"Risky subject by SLB, Alia delivers as usual.","My Rating : 6/10.'Gangubai Kathiawadi' is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's next after the much lauded 'Padmaavat'. Much like the quaint cinema world he is known for, this is no different in that regard. The story is however very sad and depressive overall.Alia Bhatt is at her best and no doubt gives an outstanding performance however the movie has lots of melodrama and dialoguebaazi - if that's your thing.OK for a one-time viewing.

MuviFan73,26 February 2022,Alia steals the show. Sanjays choices rock.,"Story: The story is about the sex worker. It shows how she ended up in red light area Kamathipura and finally rises and ends up fighting for rights of sex workers in same area.Cinematography: Impressive. Being a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film this area impresses. The sets ( kotha, streets, etc) are fantastic with respect to topic of subject we are dealing.Direction: Direction coming from Sanjay Leela Bhansali is more than just being median. Sanjay takes control of items (like choreography) more than direction and ends up on a good note.Acting (& music): Alia is great. Others are either average or above average. Music is average.Final Verdict: It might be question of debate if Alia was a right choice for the role. The thing is she brings glamour to the role. If Sanjay selected her and made movie basically around her, he wins in the bet.The rights of sex workers in India are not legal. The movie differently advocates that area. The thing is illegally it's still in work. As preached by Gangu its legalization will bring rate of crime against women down. A subject which can be given a thought.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

This one is to step out from our regular world to face the harsh realities of life. This movie is one kind of rude, however necessary awakening.I am amazed by background score and songs, especially by Shreya Ghoshal and Neeti Mohan ones. Just mesmerising!The direction is very good and it virtually gets you in the ally of Kamathipura.Better could be climax that could have been shorter which sounds lengthier.

KT_Katty,25 February 2022,Over Glamorization Of A Gritty Story,"With a ton of foundation on her face, well-ironed designer saaris, glamorized hair-styles - Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Gangubai may as well have been called - 'Chandramukhi'. But she, from nowhere, looks like a sex-worker from Kamathipura. The director, who has been obsessed with showing his females in extravagant Indian attires, has yet again presented a sugar-coated beautified version of reality. It is tedious, to see him do the 'same-old same-old' with all his female characters, film after film. If not for the visual extravagance that backs him, will he even be much of a filmmaker? I wonder....

beevenkat,4 March 2022,Performances are admirable,"A prostitute confidently walks into a convent school to secure admission for her ""daughters"". The school sarcastically asks for the name of their father. She audaciously replies ""Dev Anand"". So who exactly is #GangubaiKathiawadi? Is she an innocent girl from Gujarat? Is she a sex worker? Is she a mafia queen? Is she a mother to abandoned girls? Is she a wily politician? Do watch the film in cinemas to understand her and to appreciate her efforts to rehabilitate dumped women. Performances are admirable. The music perfectly matches the mood of the film. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Rating 3.5/5.

This without doubt is one of best films.All cast have done a good job special mention to Vijay Raj and Ajay Devgan But the main star of the film is without a doubt Alia Bhatt she carries the film like nothing,this is one of the best performance I have seen.The best thing about the film is it's cinematography I don't know who did this but Sanjay Leela Bhansali always have had a good sense of cinematography even wrost of Bhansali film have a decent photography.Overall very good film I enjoyed it, so can definitely Sanjay's less sappy filmüòÇ.",9/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Such beautifully designed, well crafted and well acted.Never thought Alia Bhatt can act this level of portray of a character. She was mesmerising. I have seen her all previous movies and know she is a really good actress but there were other actors too in other movies. After Highway, Udta Punjab, Dear Zindagi and Raazi, this is the another movie which proves she is a powerhouse when it comes to acting. Vijay Raj as always outstanding in the movie.Sanjay Leela Bhansali deserves credit too. He is the heart and soul of the movie. Even with so many things to do by himself ( Director, writer, Screenplay, Producer and Music Director) He manages to pull all of these for his movies. That's a master class of film making. Production design as always Grandeur and beautiful of Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies.(-)ve:
*Ajay Devgan and Vijay Raj were fantastic but had little role.*Other Supporting casts were ok.*Music was ok ok which usually don't happen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali movies. Same goes to songs.Only two songs ""Meri Jaan"" and ""Jab Saiyad"" were good.*Screenplay could have been little more gripping. 5-10 min. Could have been edited. Run time could have been less like 2 Hrs. 20min. In my opinion.Story: 8/10

Another is worst story writing, same old Rahim Chacha phenomena and Kafiro ko marenge wali bogus language.Gangu with high dreams come to mumbai, sold to brothelhood, some tears here and there, and then Rahim chacha comes to save her, and then she becomes sudden tigress with education to prostitutes......as they can speak in english to customers ......

merisoch,27 February 2022,"Perfect movie attacked by vote brigading from ""anti-nepotism gang""","One of the rare movies that has the power to make you think and challenge your beliefs and assumptions. One of the better Bollywood movies I've seen. The movie is about the plight of prostitutes and empowering women. Most of the scenes are about Gangubai and her struggle, and her efforts to make life better for her entire red-light district. Some parts of the story are predictable but shown in a captivating way. Each and every second is executed perfectly which is typical of Bhansali's movies. There is a small touch of beautiful folk music too. The performance of all actors was phenomenal. This is not just a movie, but a lesson for young people as the problem is still widespread.After SSR's death Alia Bhatt has been constantly trolled from the anti-nepotism gang, which has affected her film ratings and comments on IMDb, YouTube and other sites (just see YouTube comments of any Alia video). I'm 100% against nepotism but it should not be a reason to downvote movies. The movie is created by lots of people who never benefited from nepotism.",10/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Though it have it's pros of looking younger than your age but this movie required someone bold looking. Set was ok but cheap looking and completely cheap VFX feeling. Vijay Raj, Ajay Devgan and huma qureshi's acting was not enough due to very bad casting of the lead actress. Also it manipulated the real story to make a Hero out of someone villainous in real life. Overall a propaganda movie.

SoumikBanerjee25,26 April 2022,Alia runs the show!,"Sanjay Leela Bhansali, this man needs no introduction; he's a genius in his craft; a master craftsman so to say. His productions have always been imperial, in the truest sense of the word, fraught with nothing but exuberance and vigour! Gangubai Kathiawadi is no exception.An arresting set of stunning imageries confederated with a tantalising score and some great musical numbers; Bhansali's artistic predisposition resonates in each characteristic of his work. On top of that, we've got an all-important societal angle involving the sex workers and their collective struggle for their rightful privileges & honour.Nevertheless, this is Alia's film through and through. I'm at a loss for words right at this very moment; all thanks to a graceful Alia Bhatt and the bewitching performance she managed to put forward. Albeit we all are pretty much aware of her capabilities as a performer, still, it seems that she never really stops outperforming our expectations.Although I'll confess (with a heavy heart) when the first announcement came through, and I came to know that Alia's been cast as the main protagonist; I wasn't fully confident, I too had my reasonable share of scepticism, not because I didn't have faith in her skills but for the sheer fact that this was quite different from any of her earlier endeavours, this was something she had never done before. ""Will she be able to pull it off?"" That's the question I had in my mind.And now I have to say, she proved her mettle (yet again) and I'm simply blown away! The way she transitioned from a gullible, innocent 'Girl' to a vicious, determined 'Woman'; this particular journey of hers was a sight to behold. Her look, her get-up, her all-around demeanour; it is needless to say that she got into the skin of her character and to tell the truth, people will expect nothing less from this point forward.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

nivesingh,28 February 2022,worth getting to know gangubai's story,"It's a dark film, the actors have justified the characters- Ajay Devgun is too good, his acting is understated and impactful. Alia bhatt is well suited for this deglam role, though she seems a bit artificial at times, still this has been her best performance so far. Overall, this movie has too much unnecessary overacting, over dramatic scenes and over the top dialogues that remind us of the earlier bollywood films, yet it was good to go to a theatre after 2 years. So, in a way this is not Sanjay Leela Bhansali's best. Finally, it is good to know gangubai's story.

nadkarnisumeet,25 February 2022,Likeable despite its flaws!,"Gangubai Kathiawadi review :The first biggie Bollywood release after the Omicron wave; it was a pleasure to watch Gangubai Kathiawadi at Movietime Starcity Cinema, Matunga first day first show with a crowd of youngsters who seemed to be Alia Bhatt fans. Indeed, the theatrical experience can never be matched by any home theatre system- however big. Films like these are meant for theatres only. No two ways about it!!Anyway, the film starts with a close up shot of an underrage girl being decked up for sale. As her nose is forcibly pierced, you see blood oozing out and dripping from her chin. This chilling scene sets the tone of the supposed biopic on a real life madame of Kamathipura who was sold in to flesh trade by her suitor and then rose through the ranks to become a mafia queen cum political bigwig of that entire area.Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a master craftsman and his visuals are always mesmerizing. Here, he literally turns the innards of Mumbai's Grant Road in to a desi Moulin Rouge. The sets are fabulously authentic and I was particularly impressed with the way they have recreated the Alfred and New Roshan Talkies in that locality. Excellent job indeed!!Infact, the entire first half keeps you thoroughly engaged as we see Alia Bhatt transform from the innocent Ganga to dhandewali Gangu and finally to Gangubai, the President of Kamathipura. Her trajectory is superbly executed and I particularly liked her short lived affair with a much younger tailor called Afsaan (Shantanu Maheshwari). The scene where she bathes in front of him is truly erotic without being vulgar. It reflects the class of Bhansali!!Post interval, Gangubai morphs in to a long drawn political drama as she turns a crusader of women rights and pushes for legalizing flesh trade. Her much touted meeting with then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru however seems abrupt and badly edited. The climax too lacks punch.Of the cast, Ajay Devgn evokes ceetis even in a special appearance. His introductory walk is truly a wow moment! Vijay Raaz excels in a small role of Gangubai's competitor. Chhaya Kadam leaves her mark as well. Jim Sarbh deserves a special mention though his character appears only in the second half.Coming to Alia in the titular role, she clearly lacks the experience and maturity to play a prostitute turned mafia queen. Compare her to the scintillating Sharmila Tagore in Mausam (1975) or Smita Patil in Mandi (1983), Alia comes across as a school bully here. It is not that she doesn't try. Her hardwork and dedication are visible in each and every scene but the lady just doesn't look believable as the fiery and feisty Gangubai. A classic case of wrong casting. That remains the film's biggest sorepoint!!All said and endured, Gangubai Kathiawadi still works as a Bhansali film. It may not be his best effort but definitely, is a cut above the commonplace. Bollywood buffs should watch it. It is a much needed respite after the dry spell since Christmas!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",6/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi
lakkin,26 February 2022,"Story is OK, but can't see child artists in the role, very irritating to see alia in lead","Don't talk about bhansali he is a legend but much more interest in selecting cast and crew and songs are like old and not as good as expected,, and it's a wate of money and not to with young children because we don't want our children to learn these illegal. Very bad to see bollywood going towards only remake and that to swake like gehriyan(B grade movies also releasing in theatre with very bad messages to youth and that to towards relationships, very hard to see, movie with only romance, intimation scenes and betrayel) very shame bollywood that bollywood have no good directors.

shaikhirshad-41223,25 February 2022,WORTH IT....,"At first when I saw Alia Bhatt playing Gangubai wasn't sure she will perform best or not. But After watching the movie she completely nails it with the character. Specially the dialogue delivery was outstanding. She completely gets into the character and carry out the whole film to his shoulder. Supporting cast such AJAY DEVGN no words will required to describe him. Whenever he comes on screen playing such a character he always shine. Dialogues are the highlights of this movie. Whenever we talk about Bhansali direction only one thinks come in our mind and that is CINEMATOGRAPHY. And the director has given his best with direction, musical & cinematography.Story, screenplay was satisfying but I think we should still more of a struggle than what we see in the movie. Anyway superb movie after a long time
The story of Gangubai and her struggle should definitely hear by every audience.....

Her voice, her body profile betrays a certain weakness and, as a result, the character fails to deliver.

MovieAnalysis,27 February 2022,There Might Be A Queen But No Mafia In Gangubai Kathiawadi,"Background & Synopsis:
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Gangubai Kathiawadi, tells the story of Ganga Harjeevandas Kathiawadi and showcases her journey of becoming a prominent name among Mumbai's Mafia from a sex worker.The film is said to be inspired by a chapter 'The Matriarch of Kamathipura' in Hussain Zaidi's book 'Mafia Queens of Mumbai'.Cinematic Analysis:
Bhansali's films are well known for two things: First, they are so gorgeous that they look like a painting & second, the controversy surrounding them and Gangubai Kathiawadi is no exception. He once again creates a magnificent and astonishing world of Kamathipura the infamous red-light area of Mumbai in this film. The sets, lighting and camera work, without any doubt, are impressive and one of the noticeable aspects of the film.One of the most debated topics related to this film was its casting i.e. Alia Bhatt in and as Gangubai. I'm no fan of Alia Bhatt but it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this is Alia's film. She gives her carrier's best performance with consummate elegance. It's an absolute pleasure to watch Ajay Devgn and Vijay Raaz on the screen who steals the show but his role is very limited, most of which we already watched in the trailer.The songs suit the film but you won't be humming any of the songs once you leave the theatre.Gangubai Kathiawadi's story is divided into three phases where first she becomes Gangu from Ganga and then from Gangu to Gangubai. The first half is solid and have some extremely heartbreaking moments but the other half just drags the storyline and doesn't provide much to care for.In its final act, the film not only demands to legalize prostitution but also tries to justify it with a speech instead of seeking the betterment of life of all those girls/women who were forced into this business at a very young age.The film showcases just one side of the story i.e. The brighter side of the character and chooses to skip the darker side. There must be some reason she was known as Mafia Queen, right?Even if Alia's performance is outstanding, she looks like an outsider because of all that makeup in comparison to her co-stars in Kamathipura. Dialogues are well written with some crowd-pleasing punch lines as well because 'Taliya Bajti Rahni Chahiye'. It's unclear what Bhansali wanted to achieve by this film and especially by its final act.Conclusion:
Gangubai Kathiawadi is visually pleasing with powerful performances but its final act water down its power and effectiveness. It seems like the film presents less than it hides about Gangubai's actual story. There might be a queen but no mafia in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Gangubai Kathiawadi.6.5/10.Follow on Instagram: m_movie_reviews.",6/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

This looks interesting and it's only a movie length. So I'm watching it. Looks like it's from India but you normal downtrodden Indian woman.. It looks good but it's not in English and no subtitles. Am I going to keep watching? I'm not really understanding it but I'm truly fascinated by the cultural practices. I'll come back tomorrow as I need to processed what I have seen. Lots of body language language talking.I'm so happy the English subtitles have appeared so I'm going to rewatch the whole thing again. I'm only half way through it in Hindi. Love it already.It is an awesome but sad story of a world dominated by men but Gangubai makes the best of her situation. Improving the lives of the prostitute and giving them a feeling of self worth but it is a hard lonely. She was duped by the handsome man she loved. He told he was going to make her a movie instead he brought her to Kathiawadi and sold her to the madam of the brothel.The quote that sticks in my mind is when her best friend dies and they are preparing her for the funeral. Gangubai says""Tie her legs tightly. Men cannot be trusted with not even with a dead body."" How horrible is that.She is a powerful fighter for women and never gives up. She sends her message out to the world with the help of Journalist Fezi.A woman with a golden heart.The film is based on the true story of Gangubai Harjivandas. Her life was documented in the book 'Mafia Queens of Mumbai' penned by S. Hussain Zaidi. The film is produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Jayantilal Gada.",9/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Ansango,1 May 2022,Wow-worthy!,"Emotionally charged, Thoughtfully defiant and potently acted, Gangubai Kathiawadi is a powerful tale of a very uncommon heroine and a example of rags-to-riches done right. This, in my opinion, is among the best biographies Bollywood has produced in recent times. This film is a further proof that Alia Bhatt is the greatest actress from our generation. I feel that his character was a bit too loud at times, but the blames lies solely on writing. Alia is the heart and soul of the film and she never misses a beat. Her performance is pitch perfect.Ajay Devgan is there too as a gangster Rauf Lala and looks his part perfectly, bit still acts in Tanhaji mode. Vijay Raj's look is brilliant but surprisingly his role is a lot tamer than you would expect, and since writing doesn't support his character that much, his acting doesn't registers as much as it should have.The writing could have been better since it's a film set in the underbelly of Bombay Underworld, yet stakes never feel high and it looks like the hurdles are overcome too easily. Music is good and the haunting BGM is awesome, but music here has not much purpose and instead acts like roadblocks in the flow of this film. It also would have been shorter had the dance numbers been edited out because a runtime of 150+ minutes starts to feel like a lot, especially in the last act.I still think that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has a great eye for visuals, but on direction front, he's average at best. While the grounded approach here suits him much better than epic dramas like Bajirao Mastani, he still could have done so much better with the character of Gangu, but instead chooses to focus on his internal emotions and conflicts only in some fleeting moments.But overall, Gangubai is an incredibly well-made biography with a very relevant social subtext. Just go and watch it, it's great.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Screen play is slow and movie is dragged on for hours. Same old female don repeted with no actual originality. Ajay devgn is fine as always but without a good supporting actor he fails to deliver a powerful role. SLB has lost it with this one.Overall quiet boring and unwatchable. Surely u can skip this one.

jessistew,25 February 2022,"Lazy writing, and weak direction","First of all, Gangubai Kathiawadi a deadly long narrative. It's almost 170 minutes long and you have nothing to see that you couldn't predict. The over the top dialogues try to infuse some life into this half-dead storyline, but are actually laughable.What it lacks the most is an engaging screenplay and a gripping line-up of events. The marathon journey of Gangu never looks convincing because all the conflicts in her life end up without any strong results. Gangu becomes a Mafia queen, but do we see her in that chair? No. Gangu fights for the election, but what happens after that? We don't know. Gangu sacrifices her love - just like that, and do we have any proper follow-up for that? No. Gangu even sizzles on the magazine cover and gives a big, loud speech, but what does she get from it? Nothing. These questions will make you believe that Bhansali's craft is not cement-proof.All in all, very DISAPPOINTED.",1/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

snehakakroo,1 May 2022,Decent movie but Alia is a poor choice,"This is a decent story and a good attempt at a biopic but Alia doesn't suit the casting. She gave her 100% but 5 minutes of screen time of Vijay Raaz and Ajay Devgan was so powerful compared to Alia that it makes you realise the difference between a commercial heroine and a powerful actor. Alia is a wonderful commercial actress but she is not powerful an actress to be able to convey a biopic and make the audience invest their time and energy for 2 hours plus of screen time.

GajaaKesari,4 March 2022,A colossal failure of effort,"Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a seasoned producer/director and has best cinematographer, set designers and costume designers. On the visuals, this movie is of course A+. The movie weaves a rich luscious texture visually. But if it was visuals only then one would as well watch some wild life show on high definition TV.First of all the title. The movie is loosely based on Gangubai Kothewali, where the ""Kotha"" means the brothel and Kothewali translates to ""Brothel owner"". The director and the producer changed the movie title to Gangubai Kathiawadi and thus committed a major faux pas. That is, they tarnished people in the western state of India.Second, the dialogues. It is tiring to see Ajay Devgn just try to use his ""smoldering eyes"" and minimal dialogs. However here it falls flat, since brothel owning, pimping, human trade, pedophilia is shown as a ""Business"" with ""Moral"" outcomes and mafia dons are shown with more morals. The mafia takes the pimp as a business partner and the movie narrates it as a moral win!One of the dialog, the protagonist purposely twists the culture. She says ""Prostitutes are also needed in heaven"". What a shame!And bollywood will not be bollywood if it does not copy wholesale plot points or songs and tunes. Its most famous song ""Dholida"" is taken from folk music without any attribution and the gracious folk dance around the song has been morphed into a kafkaesque body movements. This is the typical bollywood now.The movie could be handled sensitively. For example, the director could have really looked at the real conditions of brothels instead of glamorizing it into an opulent palace!",1/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

ankom,24 February 2022,Slap to nepotism!! An open debate,"Siddha point pe aata hu! This movie is a sheer disruption to claims of nepotism. Its shame that today's generation has to learn about our historical and revolutionary idols via a 152 minutes movie.It is an open debate if a junior version of me after an era pens down the same thing somewhere in earth/mars...
thank-you to all the costar's of gangubaikathiawadi for an amazing portray of the unveiled facts of our history.Aliaa bhatt Ma'am aap dil mai chaa gayi ho but pyaar hum ab bhi katrinakaif ko hi karte h!!

manish-45981,29 April 2022,Are these reviews real?,"The movie is boring. The actress just can't act. I didn't even feel even a single dialogue that she delivered. No connection felt during emotional scenes. No message delivered in the movie. How she became mafia queen is completely ignored. I Guess Bollywood didn't find any other women to make the movie on so they forced it.

rishi_mathuria,26 February 2022,SLB tumbles massively with senseless story,"Unbearable acting and script. Don't know why has the director portrayed and glorified such character. Alia Bhatt has tried hard to get into the role but unable to give justice to the role. All of her roles and acting gives the feel of her role in Gully Boy. Don't waste your time and expectations.

maila-81326,26 February 2022,Gangubai to Bollywood's Rescue,"First the obvious, it is a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film so it is quite the template that the sets, the colour palette, the cinematography, the background score, and the vivid imagery would be beautiful. The ""Aaina Mahal"" from ""Bajirao Mastani"" still happens to be one of India's finest set pieces. In Kamathipura, Bhansali strips off the bombast of the aforementioned Mahal and gets the alleys and lanes of the 'forbidden' 'badnaam moholla' just the way they should be shot - a tragic painting, each frame lending to that everyday trials of these withered roses who refuse to just fade away. They want to duel with their ""taqdeer"", change it to find acceptance beyond their ""choukath"", beyond their brutal fate, beyond their ""haisiyat"".What steers this pathos-driven film are the sharp dialogues and the solid screenplay, which even when it falters doesn't let loose the essence. The song ""Mere Saiyaan"" was one of the highlights of the script picturising a romance that doesn't use words but gestures and ""adakari"".Now let's come to the cast as Bhansali puts together an ensemble of actors who shone in their brief but important roles, be it Seema Pahwa as the greedy brothel owner or Vijay Raaz as Raziabai, Gangu's arch-nemesis or Ajay Devgan as the saviour Karim Lala or Jim Sarbh as the journalist with a heart, Faiz. Alia Bhatt, the youngest of the lot, got the toughest part to handle but as the protagonist Gangubai she literally steals and owns every scene, the expression, the dialogue delivery, the ""nazakat"" were on point. She shines as the constant victim of hatred, the teary eyes as she complains ""hum toh izzat roz bechte hai saali khatam hi nahi hoti"", as she breaks down in joy in the end seeing her dreams taking some wings, as she confronts each of her nemesis. Do watch it on the big screen.",10/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Unexpected from Sanjay Leela Bhansali..I really wasted my money and now I think I should have waited for it to release on OTT.. the love interest of Gangubai was looking more like her brother than lover.. Mr. Bhansali please work on a better cast and storyline next time..I think only Deepika can pull off your movies well.

rrahulpanchaal,27 February 2022,Pathetic acting,"Didn't expect from SLB such poor direction. The real main role played by AB was not so huge in real life. Such a bad direction and dialogues were placed more as larger than life. Feel cheated when our money is wasted after so much of hype in promotions. Ajay devgn acting is same as the same in once upon a time in Mumbai. A good cameo role played. After watching film I wish I waited for OTT release.

puranjanbasak,28 February 2022,Gangubai kathiawadi,"Gangubai kathiawadi is a biographical crime drama directed by sanjay leela bhansali. Here are the positives and negatives.Performances-alia bhatt has given her best performance till date. Better than raazi, highway and udta punjab. She has shut every hater's mouth who were doubting her capabilities. Ajay devgan whenever came on screen lit up the scene. His eyes do all the talking. Vijay raaz was the best of the lot. He has a small cameo actually but boy he was exceptional.Music and background score-the background score was good but the music deserves appreciation and love. Be it dholida or jab saiyaan or my favourite muskurahat. Every song is beautiful and melodious.Writing-the writing has some minor flaws. The film takes some time to build up. But then it picks up its pace. The first half goes well but again the start of second half is weak. It simmers until vijay raaz comes into the act. But it still holds your attention.Dialogues-the dialogues are top notch and hard hitting. You can feel gangu's emotions and pain through her words, through her lines.Visual grammar-the visual grammar is brilliant. In the song meri jaan, in the car sequence the pain of gangu's life, her agony is so poetically portrayed. You just feel for her or when she goes into a trans mode in the song dholida you know that she has a lot of pain simmering inside. You just feel helpless.Gangubai kathiawadi is a film you should watch and ignore all those nonsense hate it is getting from those 'boycott bollywood idiots'. Go and watch this film. I rate it 9 out of 10.",9/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi

Her acting will touch everyone's heart this time. A lots of love to Alia. Cinematography and set design were outstanding, everything was looking real. But this movie has some negative points also, 1st of all Alia is so much beautiful as a prostitute, a prostitute can't look like an actress. In one scene Gangubai said that she has spent 15 years in that quarter, but still she is looking so young..how?

She was trying too hard. If you have nothing better to do, then maybe you can watch this pathetic movie but don't forget to carry a disprin in your bag. Only blind alia fans will like this movie.

tkmce2008,26 February 2022,Alia Bhatt delivers her best yet in Bhansali's epic biopic,"This is the longest we have gone without a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film (4 years since Padmavat) & 3 years since Alia Bhatt was in a movie worth watching (Gully Boy was the last). Though we did get a glimpse of how Alia Bhatt would look in a Bhansali-esque film in the super disastrous Kalank; but this one is the real deal. Gangubai Kathiawadi is one the most engrossing films I have watched in recent times & Bhansali makes his presence felt throughout.Gangubai Kathiawadi is the story of how an innocent girl from Kathiawad is sold to a brothel by her lover & how she rises to prominence among the sex workers; fighting for their rights & for the education of their children.Alia Bhatt as Gangubai was a tricky proposition. The teaser was lackluster & she didn't seem fit for the role. But the trailer blew my mind! Alia Bhatt was nailing it as this popular mafia queen. And Bhansali's choice of actors pays off as Alia redefines the meaning of the word: Career Defining Role. I cannot imagine anyone else portraying this character. And I didn't want the film to end solely for her performance. The supporting cast elevates the film to another sphere. Seema Pahwa's boisterous yet cruel avatar, Ajay Devgn's scene stealing cameo, Gangu's confidant played by Indira Tiwari, Jim Sarbh & Vijay Raaz are all brilliant.Bhansali's films also boast of good songs but Gangubai is a bit shaky there (except for Dholida; the quintessential Bhansali Navratri song). But if you overlook that & the relatively long runtime; Gangubai excels on all fronts especially the cast & the beautiful sets.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi
divineflame06,26 February 2022,Alia steals the show.,"As expected from any SLB film, grandeur drips from every frame, dialogue and music. While from the onset the film might seem like a regular rise from the ground kind of formulaic gangster tale. But this is not one of them. The film tells the story of a young Ganga tricked into being sold into prostitution and her subsequent rise to Gangubai. The lack of a substantial antagonist or conflict did bother me from time to time. It felt like a sore thumb sticking out from an otherwise flawless film. Apart from SLB's grand narrative the film rests entirely on Alia's young shoulders. Even after so many terrific performances people doubt her acting skills. I too had my doubts as I felt her face didn't suit this character. But boy o boy she thrashes those premeditated thoughts with full power. She is absolutely awesomeness personified on screen. I could hardly take my eyes off her when she was in the frame. Her gujrati accent, dialogue delivery, her expressions lend every ounce of authenticity required to act her part. She owns the role and it felt she was born to act as Gangubai. Safe to say she tops her Highway performance for me with this one and sets a new benchmark for herself and others as well. Coming to the brilliant support cast consisting of Seema Pahwa, Indira Tiwari, Shantanu and Vijay Raaz lend able support to Alia and are a treat to watch. I just feel Vijay Raaz's Razia Begum vs Gangubai could have been explored a lot more as their chemistry was sizzling on yhe frame and I was clamouring for more of it. Ajay Devgn's extended cameo was bomb enough and his fiery eyes lit up his scenes with Alia.The film chronicles Gangubai's struggles from the word go where she keeps passing one test from another. The production design felt artistic and grand. Even the nook and corners of brothels while feeling dirty, shabby and authentic seemed inviting due to the nature of SLB's story telling process. For the first time i felt no hummable tracks from an SLB film, which is shocking. But the BGM suits the tone and narrative. The scenes are neatly captured with wide angle inviting frames that suck you into yhe world.This might not be SLB's best work but is still a good film to watch and Alia's acting is one of the biggest reasons to watch it.",8/10,Gangubai Kathiawadi
kuengarati-33072,25 February 2022,Casting wrong as Gangubai,"Watched #GanubaiKathiawadi .And it's ultimately Disaster film SLB made. Alia doesn't seem to be fit in the role. She looks like a kid not real Gangubai. I believe casting was completely wrong and film Content is also boring and songs too not up to the mark .Overall flop movie of
SLB.

pawan-kulkarni17,25 February 2022,Sluggish and boring,"Just finished watching this movie. Don't trust people saying the low ratings are because of people boycotting Bollywood movies. Trust me, the movie lacks pace and depth subject matter demands. Casting Alia itself was a bad casting choice. Veteran actresses like Tabbu would have worked better and could managed saving this disaster.

Wolverine1990,5 July 2022,Movie is a precious gem of Indian Cinema,"I don't understand people who are going for watching Jug Jug Jeeyo, Bhool Bhulaiya(it's on Netflix), OM. This is masterpiece. BEST BIOPIC EVER MADE IN INDIA. Many scenes will make you cry. And knowing this fact, that it happened to real person of the kind Nambi Narayanan ji. You will see a kind of shock passing through you. Last scene of scooter and car will make you realize, the problem with India's system, what happens with our brilliant minds, how the system rewards them for their talent and hard work. ALL TRUE INDIANS must watch and should think what can we do in our capacity to change our system, and those who can, who are actually in capacity should act on it, as well.

Siddharthsinha-28,1 July 2022,Every Indian should watch & get inspired,First and foremost I didn't even know about Nambi Narayanan until movie was announced. What a shame. We need to seriously look at what we have been learning at schools and academics.This movie is a must watch for all Indians to know how a true patriotic has been stripped off all the achievements just on the basis of fake case. Madhvan is absolute brilliant and honest with his performance and so does the supporting cast. They have tried to inculcate all the major happenings of his life and journey and the setback.Kudos to entire team who have a winner in their hand. This movie should be encouraged and youth should get inspired to serve the country. Had Nambi sir didn't face those fake cases he would have been enjoying the same reputation as Dr Kalam.A man who is no less than a James Bond and did all this for the country and its people. Hail Nambi Sir!,10/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

Biswas_,2 July 2022,Well done R. Madhavan,"This film is based on Scientist Nambi Narayanan and his contributions to liquid fuel engines in India followed by the incidents where he was wrongly held guilty for betraying his nation. This film is presented in an interview way where our beloved SRK interviews Mr. Nambi.I must say the biopic has been made in a very interesting way. It keeps you hooked till the very end. Occasionally there are light humorous moments and go very well with the flow. It is also quite informative about the journey of liquid fuel engines in our country. Towards the end, the film does get really emotional and you feel bad for Mr. Nambi when SRK pleads him for apology for what he went through.R. Madhavan absolutely nails this role. It seems he put in a lot of effort in making this film. Not only does he ace the humorous scenes but also kills it in the emotional scenes with his wife towards the end. He has lived this role. I think all the brownie points of this film is scored by Madhavan thanks to his direction as well, he has managed to make a film that is very engaging and enjoyable and emotional at the same time.Nambi's friends too give a very good performance especially that one friend who started stammering when he tried speaking to a beautiful lady was hilarious üòÇ. Nambi's wife too does a very good job.SRK has an extended cameo as the interviewer and must say, for such a small not so significant role like this, only a man with a big heart and yet being a big superstar can accept this role and that is SRK. Only big actor other than SRK was Amir Khan who is known to play such small cameos in films otherwise normally you see superstars denying such small role. SRK's last act where he begs for apology on behalf of whole nation stole the show.Negatives - i still can't believe how poorly foreign people are showcases in films . Till date they are portrayed as stereotypical and caricaturish characters . High time they be portrayed as more matured..Overall, a film that you must invest your money in and i guarantee you it will be worth your time and money.",9/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
abhilashsharma-08137,5 July 2022,excellent,"This is a kind of movie everyone wants to watch...not like fake nationalism shown by Akshay kumar in prithvi raj movie...Nambi narayan was a true patriot and this fact id very well depicted in this movie...excellent movie.

Every patriotic Indian should watch this movie to know Nambi Narayan Sir's contributions and sacrifices of many scientists like him to bring India to a place that we are in today which would have otherwise taken many many decades to achieve and lastly to be aware of how terribly a great scientist was treated by us as a nation so that we can prevent this from happening to anyone else ever again. üôèüèª

natureboy-84907,2 July 2022,Rocketry- A mission to Oscars,"R Madhavan aka Rocketry Madhavan , what a great movie to Debut with, as a Director . The movie is on Mr. Nambi Narayanan , an ISRO scientist who underwent so much of physical and mental trauma after getting framed of being a spy and arrested by Indian govt only to be later released confirming he's guilt free . Nambi is one successful scientist who had worked along with Dr Kalam sir in 1990s . It was a pleasure to know about this actual SuperStar born on 12th Dec who aimed for stars from our mother land . A movie made on him is now nothing less than an Absolute Sensation, this might not be even the apt word to mention the class of the movie , it's beyond words , may be beyond the blue sky , the stars , the galaxies possible beyond several planets . Gone are those days when I used to think Biopic's are the easiest to make , but this movie proved it wrong . So much hardwork put in by the entire crew. But for once we should agree it's definitely a Rocket Science, for few of the conversations with reference to it was a bit of challenge to understand :) still it's very minimal and ignorable . R Madhavan, one of the finest actor we have in the world cinema features as Nambi and does an extremely brilliant performance and adding to it beyond acting through this movie he also proves himself as a man with great visionary working from the seats of a director. Paired with him is Simran, she's one impeccable actress who can steal everyone's heart anyday by appearing onscreen even if it happened for a millisecond . Beyond these two there are definitely more stars to mention for their remarkable performances. Surya adds some attraction in a cameo role. The screenplay was almost flawless, the BGM, the CGI and the re-recording needs a special mention here. Dialogues in Tamil was top notch , extremely enjoyable . However the director could have avoided making the foreign nationals speak in Tamil which sounded more like the language spoken Shim Chan cartoons :). Again ignore and start your countdown to fly towards the movie hall to witness this Indian wonder. Overall Rocketry, a Mission to Oscars ! .",9/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

puranjanbasak,3 July 2022,Rocketry-the nambi effect,"Rocketry-the nambi effect is an action biography drama sci-fi film directed by madhavan.Madhavan, the actor has given a stellar performance in this film. Basically, the film revolves around him and his character only is purely fleshed out and he has justified it. Simran, as meena too gives an empathetic performance. The rest of the cast is good. The foreign actors seem to be good but i am not sure about it because someone took a conscious decision to dub their french and english and russian all into hindi and that takes out the gravity from the dialogues. I can say for me, that many a times i was disconnected becausd of the dubbing. There was no need to dub the foreign languages into hindi.The writing too is pretty good. The scientific terms about rocket science, the concepts are not oversimplified for the audience which i liked being a science student myself. I like mission mangal too but taking out the scientific approach from a science film does not justify it. Other characters apart from nambi are not really written well. Even we don't get to know much about his family members and that is the exact reason why we can connect with nambi but not with his family members so much. The screenplay is pretty much engaging specially the second half where the drama portion is built well. The first half feels a bit stretched because of the reason of dubbing etc. But it does not harm the film.The vfx used is pretty solid. It does not come across as amateurish so points for that as well. The set design and production design is also really good. The 1900s europe and USA was built really well. The hairstyles, the moustaches, the costumes make it look authentic. The cinematography is okayish nothing extraordinary.It feels really good to see SRK on the screen after so long though in an extended cameo. He too has given a solid performance.This is a solid film boasting of an earnest attempt by madhavan in showing the life of a person who was wronged by his nation. After all ""a country is called great only when the country respects those who make it great"". This is a film you should definitely watch. I rate it 7.8 out of 10.",8/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
sameerlodaya,29 July 2022,No words to define,Sameer lodayaCan't get any words for such a personality Iam nothing to write about him but it feels very proud that Iam from a nation where this kind of people existMadhavan rocked it by his direction his acting his ideology he left a mark on the entire Indian film industry he introduced the legend who was totally absent in Indian historyThis movie should be watched as a inspiration whenever we get low for small things and learn how a person gave his entire life for the nation and in return he was proclaimed as a traitor..I wonder why this movie is not TAXFREEStanding ovation.,9/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
nitsvirusboyz,2 July 2022,Recommended üëçüèº by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"An important film with an exceptional story that must be told. R Madhavan has turned director with this film and in his debut directorial he impressed everybody and handled the film very well. Hats off to Madhavan for picking this subject and not making it an overdramatized film. He deserves an applaud to show how Vikram Sarabhai, APJ Abdul Kalam, Neil Armstrong, and Cleaver Hughes were impressed by Nambi's achievements.The pace of the film in the first half is slow and a lot of rocket science jargon is used due to which it becomes difficult for some viewers to connect with the scenes. The second half is better and more engaging. It offers a few stirring & emotional moments of Nambi's interrogation, society's reaction on his family, and the climax showing Nambi Narayanan himself was the stand-out scene.This is an Award-winning performance by Madhavan, he surprises the audience with his look & body language and how he transforms into Nambi Narayanan. The makeup department does an impressive job. Simran was outstanding in the second half of the film. Shah Rukh Khan is excellent in a special appearance and his presence upraised the film. The supporting cast has done their job well with the limited written roles.Other highlights of the film are the cinematography and the background music which enhances the impact in several scenes. There was a large room for the crisp editing in the first of the film, with a runtime of 157 minutes, the film seems too lengthy.",8/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
njagtap,5 July 2022,Deserves Oscar of this,"Each and every person worked in this movie deserves appreciation they really did a great Job.Maddy superb acting and happy to see King back in screen after long time. SRK FIRE.

jay-techie2007,8 July 2022,Need More Such Movies - Watch It In Theatres - Don't Wait for OTT,"I really doubt if anyone could have done more justice to the topic than R Madhavan himself. He has poured his heart in the movie.The movie, based on real events, leaves a sense of guilt and disgust with oneself, if you are an Indian, about the way we have treated our heroes. It's very sad to see India has paid such a huge price due to greed of certain individuals.The emotion of Nambi Sir and the grief his family has gone through - has been beautifully captured which leaves you a little stunned/shocked.The cast has done a phenomenal job. Kudos to them.Definitely watch it in THEATRE.

MehdiRizvi-7867,4 July 2022,Masterpiece Movie,Madhavan portrayed the role with absolute conviction. Many were saying the first half to be boring but I totally enjoyed both the halves and would say the first half gives build up to the second.The storytelling was good and it doesn't take a lot of rocket science understanding to invest into the filmThe supporting cast especially Simran maam was good enough aur Sharukh's cameo didn't disappoint as well. In fact he made us all emotional at the climax scene.Definitely the film u should watch with family and everyone specially the young teenagers growing up aspiring to work in ISRO.And one thing to say that those who loved Mission Mangal should abstain from watching since there is neither 'puri' making job in ISRO shown here nor any melodrama or over the top dialogue deliveries frm someone like Akshay. Madhavan didn't let us down and used less cinematic liberties.,8/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

pal-gandharv,24 August 2022,A good biopic of an Indian gem,"Rocketry - 7.3/10A good comeback in the 2nd half and somehow saved the almost flat movie in the first half with too many deliberate unnecessary ostentatious totally randomly put scenes. Some of 'em didn't even have the relevance in the movie like the Rolls Royce thing, hydraulic engines for practice and no display of that in the movie simply puts forward the intentional KOHINOOR topic. Yes some chilling moments when VIKAS went beyond 135 secs but the superhero thing was completely uncalled for. The fundamental gap between the audience and the pace of the movie in the first half is like you run on a treadmill but the treadmill's and your speeds are different, so you will definitely meet the accident. The first half was just to show how great the rocket scientist was but with no continuity whatsoever. The 2nd half was the savior when the same scientist was jailed for being a traitor. The story calms down so does the screenplay and audience starts connecting and relating the marvelous yet irrelevant 1st half. Good acting, dialogue delivery in the 2nd half. Overall, a good watch but yes, the 9.1 is definitely too much. India needs to slow down in emotions and react to the right content instead of selling itself with biases.",7/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

SAMTHEBESTEST,29 June 2022,R. Madhavan Ensures A Safe Take-Off While Unfolding The Dramatic Life Of Nambi Nayanan Filled With Unbearable Strife.,"Rocketry (2022) :
Movie Review -One of the finest actors in the country, R. Madhavan, has finally shown the courage to bring the controversial life of Nambi Narayanan to the silver screen with Rockery: The Nambi Effect. This is quite like a biopic era for our generation, and frankly, it is getting too much nowadays. However, there are some biopics that are worthwhile. There are some stories that deserve to be told in cinematic aspects so that more and more people will know about them. R. Madhavan's film, Rocketry, is definitely one of those few films. The sensational story of the great Nambi Narayanan deserves your attention for sure.Rocketry is based on the life of Nambi Narayanan, a former scientist and aerospace engineer of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), who was falsely accused of espionage. The film shows us the great sacrifices he has made for the country, the great achievements that have helped the Indian Space Organisation to stand equally with global superpowers, the great torture he endured, and his great patriotism. Overall, it's all about his Greatness! At the same time, the film does not hesitate to show the ugly face of our system, which includes cops, politicians, and many faceless and unknown threats. R. Madhavan's writing tries to cover most of the events, and fortunately it succeeds in collecting most of them within 150 minutes. There are some fantastic scenes which will leave you with joy, tears and jitters, but there are a few scenes that will make you feel guilty for doing nothing. We have all been just mute spectators while Mr. Nambi Narayana was going through hell on earth. While we talk about pluses, we should not forget the flaws. Rockery has a few dull moments, a couple of overdramatic scenes, and some unnecessary masala which could have been avoided. The first half is a little complicated for the masses. I am sure those backbenchers would feel like going back to physics classes during those scenes, and unfortunately, there are no Hindi subtitles, either. The second half is much better, though, and it manages to cover the lost ground somehow.Rocketry is all about R. Madhavan's brilliance. The actor R. Madhavan. I was counting his finest performances, such as ""Alaipayuthey"" (2000), ""Anbe Sivam"" (2003), ""3 Idiots"" (2009) and ""Vikram Vedha"" (2017). Rocketry: The Nambi Effect is one more addition to this great list. Yes, he is that good here. There were a few scenes where I think he went wrong with the accent, but the rest of the time, he was truly flawless. Simran, backed by years of experience, excels in the role of Meena Narayanan. She may not have too many scenes, but whatever scenes she has, she is phenomenal in those. The small but important roles of Gulshan Grover as APJ Abdul Kalam and Rajit Kapur as Vikram Sarabhai are delightful. In the supporting roles, Misha Ghoshal, Muralidharan, Dinesh Prabhakar, Karthik Kumar, Phyllis Logan, Vincent Riotta, Shyam Renganathan, Sam Mohan, Sriram Parthasarathy, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Bijou Thaangjam are superb. Shah Rukh Khan has about 10-12 minutes of screentime, and he seduces you with his charm. He's not in that form in the beginning, but picks up later on. Watch out for the final scenes that have him in those highly emotional segments.Rocketry seems like a big-budget film when you see it on screen. Shot across multiple countries, this one is a lavish outing despite its moderate budget. Sirsha Ray's cinematography makes sure that you feel the locations, and more importantly, those rocket, equipment, and engine scenes. The background score is so good there that you literally feel like the earth is quaking right there under your seat. The music is situational and that was a really good move by Madhavan. He knew that there was already a lot of stuff to show in Nambi's life, so why waste time on songs? The VFX team has also done a nice job considering the limited budget and scope for it.R. Madhavan makes his debut with this film, and he certainly has a long way to go and a lot to learn. He was handling multiple responsibilities here. Direction, production, writing and acting. It's like rocketry is all about him. So if there's something good, then he is the only person who deserves appreciation, and if there's something wrong, then he is also the only person to be blamed. Nevertheless, it is a very nice attempt. Maybe too much responsibility has put too much pressure on him and that's why I misplaced a few things, but that's still okay. He hasn't dropped the cup down. It's just a little quivering, and then he grabs it. Rocketry could have been an even better product with the kind of sensational story it has, but somewhere something is less. But isn't that too much to ask for? Nobody else dared to pick this story, Madhavan at least tried and gave his honest efforts in making it. So, let's appreciate him for that and overlook small glitches. As a whole, Rockery makes for a worthwhile one-time watch with one of the most important stories coming out of the scientific department of our country. You have to watch to know the greatness of Nambi Narayanan and the superiority of R. Madhavan.RATING - 6/10*",6/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

joshisurya,2 July 2022,The Movie that every Indian needs to watch.,"I have seen a lot of movies in theaters and I have paid a lot of money for them but I have never felt so stunned after a movie. I think for a movie with a low budget and for a first time director Mr. R. Madhavan has done an impeccable job. I am quiet upset that movies like this are not valued and they are highly underrated. I hope Indian audience will start appreciating movies like Rocketry.

asif_ishti,14 August 2022,Emotional Indians inflated the ratings,"I am reviewing it from a non-Indian (aka non-emotional) perspective:
No doubt the movie plot was interesting but I didn't find Mr. NAMBI a hero that the movie potrayed. Of course he was unfairly treated by the system and he deserves a good compensation from the Indian govt and people. Thus, his acclaims are well deserved. Yet, the way the movie claimed that India is the first nation to go to Mars in the first attempt and Mr. NAMBI made it happen were blatant exaggeration. It seems Mr. Nambi is a brilliant scientist who kept looking for stealing ideas, data, and resources. He got everything from other countries and the movie made a big fuss about it by claiming he did it from scratch. The way the movie presented ISRO was saddening. There were other good scientists, including APJ Kamal, there as well but the movie kind of showed everyone incompetent. The movie showed big contracts with foreign countries were already negotiated by Mr. NAMBI while in reality these high level contracts could not be signed or negotiated without high level govt involvement. I think the movie overestimated Mr. Nambi and thus fictionalized many part of it.",5/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
joppanLive,26 July 2022,"Flawed, but hats off to the effort","The movie making is heavily flawed with pacing, screenplay and too many jargons; however Nambi's real life overshadowed its every flaws and made it a fitting tribute to one of greatest scientist of ISRO.

saru2020,20 August 2022,india's biggest failure presented poorly,"This film, especially the 1st part of it somehow gave a nostalgic feeling of being inside a rocket science lab since there were so many technical words that aren't so common for common people to understand and only those pursuing rocket science might know it upfront, it becomes so difficult to follow what they were conversing although the successful testing did show a humungous potential what the ISRO team has achieved, in the 2nd part, Nambi's personal incidents takes centre stage and now it somehow connects with the audience but nothing or no scene was so touching or heartwarming unless you could connect with the real incidents being around the person and that's exactly the problem of the film, where the film fails to connect despite the audience tries hard to connect with it.For a film enthusiast, this film is a failure but for a rocket science enthusiast or inter-planetary enthusiast, this film is a huge success as it tells the tale of a country's fate from a main/common man's perspective.Maybe, just maybe, if Nambi would've succeeded and not gotten betrayed, maybe today India/ISRO would've been the top player in the space tech arena taking up Space X's position as of now. This is a huge opportunity cost missed for the whole country & humankind itself, IMO.",3/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

A person who rejected million dollar package of NASA and worked for India and in return what he got...

R Madhavan had given a true honor to Mr. Nambi Narayanan...If this story was untold, there would be many who still believe that Nambi Narayanan is a traitor...SRK cameo presence was noteworthy....Overall a must watch movie just not only to make the movie hit but also to realise that if our nation had achieved feats, its because of those patriots who selflessly lived their lives for the nation...",10/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

They dont know how to honestly criticize .Even if the movie was utterly unwatchable if it was an Indian movie, they will make sure it gets 9 star reviews.Movie critics (at least honest ones) are absent in India and you will see the trend everywhere in Indian movies.",1/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
cs_rahul_kumar,3 August 2022,R Madhavan Starrer 'Rocketry: The Nambi Effect' is a Perfection to Direction !!!,"Rocketry: The Nambi Effect explores Narayanan's life as an arrogant but brilliant scientist who becomes the first person from ISRO to attend an Ivy League University (Princeton). He also manages to secure an unbelievable deal (worth 400 million pounds) from Colonel Cleaver (Ron Donachie), the CEO of Rolls Royce- armed with charm and aided by Cleaver's apparent ""Imperial Guilt"".Rocketry begins with an extended shot that suitably begins in space and travels down all the way to Earth, where we are introduced to Nambi's family. With just a few lines of conversation, Madhavan, who is also making his debut as a filmmaker, gives us a peek into the joyful family of his protagonist. When we meet them first, the family is joking around, unaware of the peril that is on their doorstep. And boom, their world turns upside down as Nambi is arrested on charges of spying.The film plays out in flashback as Nambi Narayanan (R Madhavan) narrates his life story to superstar Shah Rukh Khan in 2014. The crew filming this mammoth interview is cursing their luck for being stuck in the studio late at night for a 'long and boring' story of an old scientist. However, as Nambi begins talking, everyone including the host are riveted to his story.Madhavan dutifully covers every aspect of Nambi's journey, especially his professional feats and challenges. Nambi's mentor is none other than the prolific Vikram Sarabhai (Rajit Kapoor), who knows his prodigy only too well. When Nambi gets a full scholarship from Princeton University, he takes it up despite the obvious mismatch in what he is offered and what he wants to study. But not the one to toe the line, Nambi finds a way to not only learn what he wants but also be the best at it. So much so that he is offered a job by NASA but he chooses to work for ISRO instead and do whatever it takes to propel India's space mission.While Nambi's work life is exciting and fraught with challenges, it is also way too technical and Madhavan doesn't shy away from throwing complex astronomy terms and jargons at the audience. The entire first half is spent in showing various facets of Nambi's slightly eccentric personality and astral experiments where the very animated background score acts as a pointer for us to root for our protagonist. At times, the context is lost in technicalities and we're forced to focus on the big picture. The non-linear execution is exciting and generates anticipation but also adds to the confusion.R Madhavan relives Nambi Narayanan's real life in reel with full conviction. From his make-up to dialogue delivery and expression, Madhavan becomes the man whose story he tells. Shah Rukh Khan looks dapper as ever and uses his trademark charm to play the role of an interviewer with a heart. He mirrors the conscience of a nation for a man, who dedicated his life to a cause against all odds. Simran is a surprise package as the sensitive and dignified Meena Narayanan. Simran's portrayal goes a long way in humanising Nambi's passion for his work and the hardships he endures. Among the supporting actors, Sam Mohan stands out as Unni, whose character is a lot more fleshed out than others.The second half is much stronger and emotionally draining but the film's pace remains slow. It's no rocket science that this one's a niche film. It has an interesting subject and an untold story of a man, who was wronged for always being right for his nation. 'Rocketry' takes off well, hits some turbulence on the way, but eventually soars high with real characters and moving moments that make it worth your while.",10/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
kathiravansub-647-400035,28 August 2022,False claims! Fake movie,"Scientists who worked with Nambi Naraynan conducted a press meet and spoke about all the false claims made by Nambi in the movie. It is a shame for actors like Madhavan for not properly researching the truth and simply taking the narrative of one person who is the hero of the movie.Many things said in the movie are not true. Just enjoy the movie as a fiction. You will be a fool if you think it is truth and nothing but truth!Many things are not revealed by Nambi in this movie. The story about cryo engine research and how the delay had caused a setback for India is also another lie. I just don't understand why someone has to lie so much about them!

vaibhavwin,5 July 2022,Madhavan totally nailed it,"A must watch biopic that not just chronicles the sufferings that Dr. Nambi Narayanan and his family has gone through but also the challanges faced by Indian Space Program to develop indigenous cryogenic engine under his leadership.While watching the movie the rocket science is put forth in such a lucid way, that for a moment- one would feel like he/she is a part of the same space mission.

rahulvaidya055,8 July 2022,Ode to Bharatiye space ambitions,"This movie is a beautiful piece of art dedicated to the space scientists of our nation. It is a tribute to all those men and women who stay in our country and help in building a better future of our country. And Nambi Narayanan is one of the most important people in this aspect. Instead of giving only wings to our country's ambition, he gave us rockets to stay relevant in the space race. The movie amazingly describes his journey and the highs and unfortunate lows of his life. It shows his indomitable spirit to fight for what's right and love for his country. It showcases his invaluable contribution in building our space program and 'rocketing' it to great heights. It's a very well made movie with great acting by R Madhavan and exceptional storytelling.

vpashish,3 July 2022,Unpolished Movie,"More inclined towards the dimension of Informative documentary rather than movie.The grip of the movie from the start remains very low and your brain struggles to understand what is really happening. Huge technical details are unecessarly included in the movie which make you feel out of the place. The storyline is very good but the director badly failed to give it a shape of movie, instead made a documentary. Not worth for going and watching in theatres. The dialogues are also badly written and feel out of the place. Very confusing mixture of unstructured randomly placed scenes. Could have been done in a much much better manner.

jsataluri,29 July 2022,"Interesting, but flawed biopic","Madhavan makes his directorial debut in Rocketry, a biopic based on the life of Nambi Narayanan. I don't need to write anything about the plot as it's already been covered by most of the reviewers.We need to understand that most if not all biopics have to take creative liberty with their subjects so that it engages us as a movie goer. Otherwise, we would be better off watching a documentary. In recent times, we have seen Indian movie biopics take major creative liberties to make their subject larger than life. Sometimes the makers have to change the characterization of their subject; for example, instead of portraying GR Gopinath as his original Brahmin identity in Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru, it became a story about a downtrodden Non-Brahmin named Maara who rose up and became one of the most powerful Indian airline leaders because it needed to fit Tamil sensibilities and appease Suriya fans. On the other hand, you have hagiographies like NTR Kathanayakudu/Mahanayakudu where the protagonist is basically God and that can never go well.Here Madhavan veers between biopic and hagiography. We see Nambi Narayanan from his early days in ISRO to his elder days. His dedication towards science, space and to his country is commendable. He is so totally dedicated to his job that he will not stop until he's fully satisfied. But he is made to become as this all-knowing superhero genius who can solve everything. Nobody else has anything to contribute around him; they just surround him and applaud his ideas as brilliant. Despite a couple of scenes where his dedication and determination does cost him a slight bit of his human soul, he barely has any flaws. Maybe the real-life Nambi was like this, but the over glorification of the character is hammered hard in our skulls without any nuance.And that's the main reason why Rocketry fails to explore the human side of Nambi. We don't get to know more about him as a person, what made him tick, why he was like this, etc. We get some interesting James Bond espionage type scenes, but because the screenplay glorifies him so much, we don't feel the struggle and humiliation he went through; it just feels hollow. Nor do we get to know his family, his mentors or his friends. They are just satellites surrounding him.A lot of technical jargon is thrown at us and while I'll say that while it is indeed educative and important, you can't bore the audience with it. The pacing makes the movie feel longer than it is and there are a lot of emotional manipulation where the BGM just tries to overpower you with these loud moments that just don't stick, plus the editing is not slick enough to make you care.Having said the above, it is still a story that needed to be told and Madhavan is the sole reason you should watch it. Though he does not fit the role of a 27-year-old student in the beginning portions due to his age (despite still maintaining his good looks), he embodies Nambi Narayanan very well from his 30s all the way until his elderly days. He has put in a lot of hard work and love into this portrayal and despite the hagiographic nature as I earlier mentioned, he does make the character watchable. The real Nambi Narayanan makes an appearance towards the end, and it was good to see him speak in his own voice.On the other hand, the rest of the cast don't have any role to play and it's sad to see Simran, Misha Ghoshal (a talented actress), Karthik Kumar (who reminded me of Atul Kulkarni), Rajiv Kapur/Ravi Raghavendra and Sriram Parthasarathy wasted in underdeveloped roles. While there is some dignity given to the non-Indian actors where they speak their own languages instead of being dubbed in Tamil or Hindi, the less said about them the better. Neither Suriya (Tamil) or Shah Rukh Khan (Hindi) impress in their cameo.Sirsha Ray also deserves credit for the cinematography which helps engage the viewer somewhat and the CGI isn't so bad.Overall, while the majority of people may be inspired and wholly satisfied by this labor of love by Madhavan to Nambi Narayanan, others will feel disappointed that the making did not do justice to the human element of the man. Despite my problems with the movie, I'm glad it was told and it's strictly a one-time watch movie thanks to Madhavan. He is one of the rare actors who cares about his audience and wants to give them good concept and content-based movies. He doesn't fully succeed here, but he did at least engage me somewhat. Hope he improves in his next directorial feature and continues to give appealing content with better form throughout his career.6/10.",6/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

Bollywood has been unfair with this generous personality and has either poked fun on him by addressing him as Sharimukh's copy or has always given him films that are of low budget. I never saw him doing any big budget bollywood film till now which is saddening . But now it seems good to see him being a big name in South industry and the love he has been showered by their's audiences has brought him the position that he deserves. This time the topic he chose is quite sensitive and enlightening because the story is based on a scientist about whom hardly people know but I assure you that after watching this film, you are never going to forget the scientist because his life journey has been so struggling and inspiring. No where in school we were ever taught about this person but it seems good to know him now because no matter what the result is at the end, at the end of the day it's you who has it's own perception.

Nobody could've played the character and conveyed the depth of the story than Madhavan here. Clearly showed he didnot do this for commercial success or career graph but to convey the message through the movie.

SoumikBanerjee25,31 July 2022,"A film, every citizen of this country should watch!","A competent amalgamation of Drama, Science & Debate, ""Rocketry"" exhibits an inspirational yet tragedy-filled journey of one genius mind, S. Nambi Narayanan, and his vital contributions in the field of Space engineering that are truly meritorious. Whatever the sacrifices he made, whatever the accomplishments he attained for this country, should have granted him a nicer fate!It pains me to hear that such a true patriot was deprived of the due recognition, due respect that he unquestionably deserved, for so many decades! All thanks to a falsified case, and a premeditated conspiracy against him to derail not just his progression as a pioneer in his field, but also to halt all the advancements in his research and the miraculous discoveries he might have made in the process.The damages that are done are irreversible, and the horrible things he and his family had to go through are disheartening to say the very least. No matter how many apologies he's got, the agonizing pain he endured won't ever get entirely eradicated. He would have to carry this burden until his last breath! The only thing we could do now is to watch this film, spread the word, and make people aware of all the things that transpired.Albeit the technical jargon and a flamboyant exhibition of scientific terminologies might get a bit overwhelming for some but I feel, this film should act as a lesson for every resident, every individual in our country who in comparable instances tend to victimize a person over the slightest skepticism, that too without concrete rationale, and without validating any of the allegations! These media trials, these kinds of malpractices of should come to an end.",7/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
beevenkat,24 July 2022,"based on Nambi Narayanan, an Indian scientist","Kudos to producer-director R Madhavan for conceiving #RocketryTheNambiEffect, based on Nambi Narayanan, an Indian scientist who worked at the Indian Space Research Organisation. Extremely intelligent, dedicated, patriotic and badass, he always focused on his goals. He spurned a very lucrative offer from NASA and preferred to work in his own country. It makes your blood boil to see him and his family suffer for no reason. The common man may not appreciate the first half. However, the post-interval sections are intriguing. Performances are excellent. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Rating 3/5.

chand-suhas,8 August 2022,Amme Bhagavathi!,"R Madhavan's ambitious project works better in the second half. The biography on Nambi Narayanan is told via flashbacks where Suriya's tv interview anchors the screenplay. The first half is dedicated to show the growth of Nambi as well as establishing what kind of person he is. A patriotic brilliant scientist on a mission, taking forward the legacy of Vikram A Sarabhai. With a lot of scientific and technical jargons, the first half went with expected pace with not too many highs.It is the second half with Nambi Narayanan getting falsely accused as a traitor, the screenplay gets the emotional aspect right. Where the director R Madhavan stumbles, it is the actor R Madhavan who scores big time. Good thing is there is not much insertion of sermons here. Yet, the man and his family's struggle through this phase is effectively captured. The appearance by the real Nambi Narayanan was a fine touch.

deepaknadgir,5 July 2022,This movie proved that movie critics are really useless.,"This review is not do much about the movie as much about how you shouldn't trust critics and form your own opinion after watching the movie. So before watching this movie i read some reviews online. The one that almost stopped me from watching was from Ashwini Kumar Mishra. It was nothing like how they said it was. I was very hesitant to watch this movie after reading that review. According to them this movie is political and religious propoganda. After watching this movie i can confidently say its anything but. Its a biography and to stay true to real life its show Dr. Nambi praying and going to temple which is what he does in real life. How does that become propoganda. Its not just one review i read many more with same viewpoint. So what is real problem? A big and successful scientist have religious beliefs or that he doesn't have ""the right one""?

Madhavan as the lead acts extremely well in the second half, but in the first half he feels somewhat himself than the character he is playing. The acting of the other actors are somewhat inconsistent as well. Overall, it's a good film.

parthmeenu,18 July 2022,Part of the much needed cinema wave we need,"Bollywood has long been stuck in a certain place too obvious to state, but this film is a part of the movement that is changing it.While the Screenplay could be slightly tighter and state less of the very obvious and already shown, the Direction was truly commendable. There were many directorial calls and technical quirks that should be appreciated in this film, the subtle Aspect Ratio change to state one, and the decent realism of the CG to state another.And I don't think anyone would question the performances of the talent involved in the film. Casting of a few important persons depicted could have been slightly better, however.Even if not the best film one could see in theatres, it truly is one you should watch. Indian Cinema needs encouragement of such kind, to make and keep making films as such.Kudos!",7/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

abhishekgowdaks,3 July 2022,It's more like a documentary than a movie,"Overall, it's a pretty good movie based on the life of genius ISRO rocket scientist Nambi Narayan, who was dragged into a mess, due to leak of sensitive information, which he is not even part of it. The man behind the success of ISRO, who once rejected offer from NASA, was pulled into that mess without even realizing how much contribution has been done by him towards the country's space mission. After watching the movie it feels like his patriotism made him and his family go through such troublesome life. He could have taken up the offer from NASA and enjoyed his life to his fullest but he chose his country and this is what he got. This is how India is loosing so many indian talents to countries like USA, UK.... As long as we stick to reserved seats instead of deserved seats, talents like nambi narayan will be out of india's hands, I'm pretty sure no one in this generation will prefer patriotism over money.",10/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

tkmce2008,3 July 2022,Madhavan excels as Nambi Narayanan!,"The long awaited biopic of Nambi Narayanan, former scientist of ISRO has R Madhavan wearing multiple caps: screenwriter, dialogues, director, producer and actor. I can't say that he excels in all departments but he is stellar as Nambi Narayanan.Rocketry is narrated by Nambi Narayanan (Madhavan) to Shah Rukh Khan over a TV interview wherein he covers his early days at Princeton to the time when he was wrongfully accussed of selling secrets to our neighbours.Rocketry rests on the very capable hands of Madhavan. He is perfect as the man who led India's foray into space exploration. Many of the significant events of his life are covered in this 2.5 hour long film. His short tenure at Princeton & NASA, at the France Space Agency and for the most part under the suspicious eyes of his fellow countrymen. Simran (his onscreen wife), Rajit Kapur, Dinesh Prabhakar co-star.Madhavan is a great actor but his filmmaking skills are still in the nascent stages. But given this is his directorial debut and the effort gone into making it, one must give the actor due credit. They could have done away with the TV interview with SRK/Suriya bit. A straight-forward storyline would have been absolutely fine.Madhavan's Rocketry, which he calls his biggest film till date lives upto to the expectations (for most part). A no-nonsense story of a man the country wronged should be on your must watch list for this week.",7/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
gauravmatsh,2 August 2022,It could be better if film would be short,"Mission Mangal was very special for India and this story revolves around that but the flim is very long.

anp89162,5 September 2022,Not fully realistic.,"Nambi Narayanan is treated as a superhero in the film. To be very frank, it could have been more realistic..
1. Chasing by US army in Soviet Union while India was transporting the Cryogenic Engines, which was not happened really.2. Nambi Narayanan applied for Voluntary Retirement in real life,which was not mentioned in the film.Like these things were not anywhere near real life experience.Also his head of department recently said about his part in France/Russia. Which is clearly saying ISRO is not just depending on a person only, if the technology was known it would have been achieved even with out Nambi. Also the film saying, Its because of Nambi's arrest India was late by alteast 15 years for achieving Cryogenic Technology. But his Head of department cleary asked, on what basis they are saying this, since Nambi applied for Voluntary Retirement some weeks/months before his arrest.",3/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect

IPyaarCinema,17 August 2022,Must Watch,Madhavan as a director is like a free-flowing river. There is no set blueprint or map to his direction. But that also works in his favour. The actor simultaneously shoots two versions of the movie and it must be a task that only some can pull off. As a director he decides to invest less time in things that the audience already know.R. Madhavan has gone beyond his limit to shape Rocketry and there is no way he could have let anything go wrong from at least his end. The actor has to age back and forth and he manages to make us believe and invest through all of it. Rest everyone does their jobs earnestly and creates a world that is lived in and authentic. There are a lot of good actors involved for parts that are almost special appearances but crucial.Rocketry-The Nambi Effect is an emotional drama about how one of India's famous scientists went through turmoil after being called a traitor.It is about a man who gave this country big achievements but was compensated with brutality. It took almost two decades for the government to give a veteran scientist a clean chit in a case he was never guilty of. It is a story that must be told and heard.,7/10,Rocketry: The Nambi Effect
m-ramanan,31 July 2022,Real Nambi effect ...,"RATED 8/10
Language: Tamil
Source: amazon Prime
RECOMMENDEDMadhavan shined both as actor and director in this movie... There are lot of information about Nambi and his contribution to ISRO. It was really quite surprising to know about him at very late stage... All the science and hard work are explained in details, but the actual crime was left with some very few fast dialogs. If they detailed the crime also in detail it would be more good. Instead the last 30 mins was so sentimental and melodrama...Looks like the last 30 minutes was completely disjointed from the previous presentation....
This is the must watch for every Indian to understand the real meaning of patriotism and treason... Salute to Nambi for his fight and stand. Same to Surya and Madhavan to bring it to the big crowd.

WorldMovie99,13 March 2022,A BOLD MOVIE !,"A bold movie by Vivek Sir. This shows the trauma the Kashmiri pandits have gone through and still haunts 30+ years. The nation needs to know this. Many people still doesn't visualize the horror experienced by Kashmiri Pandits. It is seen as a simple terror strike. But it is hard hittting event of bloodshed human brutality and families being displaced.Vivek Sir is a visionary who comes with innovative flicks imbibed with emotions and ideals. This is going to be one of his best work. Well done sir.Now about technical aspects, it falls a bit short from being a masterpiece. The fireworks needed to be real, some characters remained flawed, some edges left out. But Vivek Sir daringly showed the gruesome crimes of the tragedy. The violence and fearsome part are gripping while other parts sometimes loses the grip. The tragedy of the event gets well portrayed, gives the fear.My understanding of the movie : -The real culprit of the event are not the Muslims or enemy country or the Kashmiris but the liberal Indians. This is the ugly truth showed explicitly in the movie. The liberal minds being cut off from their own religious traditions failed to grasp the ground reality of Kashmir. We should understand that Liberalism is dangerous for hypocritical society. When politics enters in that genre imagine the horror it will produce and that exactly took place in Kashmir.Summing up it's a must watch movie for the entire subcontinent. The liberals / seculars should be at the top of the viewers.",7/10,The Kashmir Files

Brave cinema like this deserves accolades.

Watch it only if you have the courage to see the truth. Vivek Agnihotri has made a phenomenal film, his career best. Anupam Kher has given the performance of his life.

They had three options writen on their house wall ""leave, convert to islam or die"". Secular Hindus will justify this genocide as they have not faced it yet. The land of Rishi Kashyap belongs to Hindus. Be unapologetic and reclaim your past glory.

rohonnag,12 March 2022,Absolutely Must Watch.,"The Kashmir Files Movie ReviewI have stopped reviewing films for all intents and purposes. I still watch a lot of cinema, but most of it is not worth commenting upon. I even saw The Batman last week and did not bother to review it.However, The Kashmir Files is not just a film worth seeing, but worth talking about.This is a difficult movie to review. Since this is more like a case file than a film. Seeing this as just an entertainment piece is not possible. This one movie tries to encapsulate the entire Kashmiri Pandit Genocide the best it can.Does this movie succeed? Well, yes as a narrative peice. But as a purely cinematic experience, it does falter at times due to technical issues.On to the positive aspects.Ever since the falsely marketing film 'Shikara' which the trailers showed like it dealt with the Kashmiri Pandit genocide, but was a love story on the backdrop of the same, The Kashmir Files movie has been on my radar as a must watch film. This same directtor made The Tashkent Files and that was a good film.Then the trailer of this film came out and it was absolutely shocking.The trailer wasn't false marketing this time! The movie is totally shocking and eye opening. Most people don't even know about the incidents being referenced in the film. So this is new information for a lot of people, not to mention, a conversation starter on this ignored and over looked genocide which happened in the recent past.The best way to describe this film is, it's like the Indian Schindler's List without the positive outcome. The displaced Pandits never made it back home. They never truly got justice.As a film, the story takes place across multiple time periods, but the narrative thread is well knit and the viewer is not confused as to which time period the film has jumped to. The acting is overall quite good, but there are a few mediocre performances in there by the extras. Mithun Da works his magic as someone who is first hand witness to the atrocities that took place as well as the inaction from the then Indian Government.Darshan Kumaar is shown as a new age rebel JNU student who wants to leave the past behind and move on. Forgive and forget he says. But it turns out he doesnt even know the reality. His acting is decent, nothing path breaking, but believable and sincere.Pallavi Joshi is still attractive as the typical JNU professor demanding freedom for Kashmir, her role is to showcase the stereo-typical (so called) liberal professor who turns students into activists. Her acting is so realistic, its difficult to separate the actor from her performance.What this film lacks, is sharpness / attention to detail in direction and acting. The low budget shows at times. Some shocking scenes are shot fine, but the VFX is lacking. The last scene was meant to be shocking, but the acting of the extras keeps it from gaining true masterpiece level.Plot wise, the current time period story-line has a non-ending as none of those plots can be resolved in real life, so they are left hanging.But all of that is not important. This film, as I mentioned is more than a just cinema, it's an information piece in the form of a film to tell the world what took place in Kashmir in the recent past. The mass genocide of Indians in their own country which no one talks about, no one outrages about or even mentions.In that goal, the film succeeds. The narration and pace is brisk, it is not boring or loud. It also shows the point of view of the 'other side' and doesn't treat the audience like fools.Rating: As a film this is a 7/10. However, this is more than film which is made, directed and produced. This is a voice for those helpless many who never got any headlines, let alone outrage or justice.As that, this is a 10/10 effort of tell a direct and hard hitting, fact filled retelling of those events.Overall : This is a film which was eagerly awaited by me and it doesn't disappoint. This is a 100% must watch for all Indians to know the real life incident which happened in our own country and we don't even know it.",10/10,The Kashmir Files
rahulwadhwani-52617,13 March 2022,MASTERPIECE,"I can't describe #TheKashmirfiles in words. It's movie is beyond anyone's review. Before watching the movie I was damn sure that Vivek Agnihotri will give proper justice to all the Kashmiri Pandits and will present the real picture and now after watching it this movie surpassed my all the expectations. After watching this movie I was like stunned, it was like a very bad dream to experience all the troma that all the Kashmiri padits bear. It was Brutal, it was hard hitting, it was engaging. The Director done perfect picturisation on subject like Hindu Pandit's genocide. Each and ever actor done perfect justice to their role. First 20 mins and last 15 mins were main Highlight in this movie. Every indian should definitely watch this movie. I rated this movie higher than every movie. For me #TheKashmirFilesReview 5/5* no doubt about it.

spacescreamer,11 March 2022,"Raliv, Galiv, ya Chaliv - The Horror That Was Kept Away From Mainstream","Anybody who has read up on the SEVEN Exoduses and Genocides of the Kashmiri Pandits would be able to recognize the scenes shown in the movie.The movie attempts to show the horrendous plight of the Pandits (and the others who were persecuted) of their past and present. To depict the amount and types of atrocities that the victims had to go through is not possible due to the censoring and the restrictions a feature film's length poses. But despite these major stumbling blocks, the amount of information and hints strewn across the movie about the enormity of the situation is remarkable.The performances by Mr Anupam Kher and Mr Darshan Kumar stood out. Ms Joshi played her role with aplomb and deserves fair share of the accolades. But Bhasha Sumbli, who played Sharda Pandit, emerged innocuously as a star. The direction was well done though the story appeared to have instances of slack and that of being rushed on a few occasions. Possibly, the censorship cuts played a role here but the movie is still supremely impactful.The mainstream channels, OTT, and ofc 'bollywood' not only distanced itself but also actively worked against this project. All this amply shows how and why depicting the truth about one of the most heinous pogrom in the history of mankind had not been attempted till now. Salute to the brave Mr Agnihotri. Hopeful that the 'Director's cut' arrives in DVD+BD+Digital options.This movie deserves the support not just in the present, but the future as well because the rivals of true cinema will not let this slide by just like that.",9/10,The Kashmir Files
ganepall,11 March 2022,A masterpiece of reality,"A top notch movie, It's hard hitting, Reality of Kashmir. Every scenes in the movie touches each and every indian. Being hindu I can not digest, I felt like to scream in some scenes, A must watch for all Hindus to see how terrorists were treated Brahmins in Kashmir. Each and every character stays in your mind after watching the movie. Anupam kher deserves some awards for his great performance in this movie. I did not feel like it's a movie it's a real painful story. I am highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. We cannot digest the last scene of the movie. Go and watch without miss.

Petrified, just looking at each other. Viewers who got their snacks before the movie, in all probability, couldn't eat as I could see trays with almost untouched food in front of chairs when they left. Saw grown ups crying like kids while coming out of the audi at the end of the movie. Eyes wet, lump in the throat. Absolute silence. Never experienced this ever before. That's the review! Not the best screenplay, not the best direction, unanswered questions, loose ends but it takes guts to make such a movie that exposes every such element who tried to tone this narrative down, hid the truth and attempted to alter the history.

It just made me felt that if tomorrow I am drown out of my home and I could never come back where I spent my childhood and adulthood scares me.Support this by going to theater so that more such movies on harsh reality can be brought to our astray minds.",10/10,The Kashmir Files

That's not necessarily a bad thing. There is after all, a fundamental difference between a movie & documentary i.e Drama.But The Kashmir files didn't need that additional dramatization. It is about the Kashmir Pandit exodus which to date remains one of the darkest periods of modern Human history. The pain, the agony and the humiliation faced by Kashmir Pandits in 1990 has no parellels, period.So, the only job a movie based on this tragedy has is to be truthful & honest. Shikara isn't. The Kashmir Files on the other hand, is. It's not just honest. It's sincere. It didn't exploit the tragedy. It emphathised with the Pandits. It showed what happened, how it happened and because of WHOM it happened.The actors did their parts well. Especially, Anupam Kher's acting was impactful and will haunt you. Technically, the movie was well made. There were a few pacing issues & it was at times very difficult to watch.But I give the movie 10/10. Director Vivek Agnihotri has shown guts in making sure the movie has no Bollywood makeup. It doesn't shy away from telling the truth about the Exodus.If this movie offends you, know that you're getting the taste of the truth that Bollywood, the media and the intelligentsia has denied you for a very long time. Make sure you don't miss it this time. Because the foundation of peace in any society is truth, not a beautiful lie.",10/10,The Kashmir Files

jomy-augustine,12 March 2022,The untold story of brutality on Kashmiri Hindus,"A much awaited narrative of true incidences which most of the political supremes in India did not allow to be narrated for over 3 decades finally comes out with a bang... A must watch for all religious people in India but must not discriminate because the times have changed now and we all want peace and most importantly the rights of our Kashmiri Pandit brothers and sisters. Only then we will become one nation.

nikhileragon,11 March 2022,At last something to show the reality for Kashmiri pandits genocide.,"This movie showed the reality of 1990 kashmiri pandits genocide and exodus. Islamic terrorism and Some so called leaders of the country let this happen. Vivek Agnihotri had the guts to show the reality against hindu phobia. Bollywood never had the guts to show the reality. Movies like Mission Kashmir, shikara and many more only put salt on the wounds of Kashmiri pandits. This movie should be shown all over the world so that everyone can know the dark time of 1990.

As a teenager, I remember, the news papers flashing news of how Kashmiri Pandits were killed in hundreds. Now watching that on a big screen, will ensure remembering those days and a true motivation to make such movies.

duttaarnab-24026,13 March 2022,An unreported tale of genocide in the paradise!!,"First of all, let's address it as the voice narrating the horrific tales of all our Kashmiri Pandits, and not just a movie. I have to admit, the movie has some very disturbing visuals and I also wonder at the same space, if it was so disturbing to us sitting in an air-conditioned theatre then, how horrible and terrifying could it be to the victims who were actually witnessing...!!!!! It was also very surprising to know how the politicians were silent and inactive to this ethnic cleansing when they were quite aware? There were also some anguishing slogans that actually echoed in the beautiful valley during the disastrous time, the early 90s of Kashmir by the oppressive majority.I was definitely in tears and my heart wrenched, knowing the true dimension of the history of that disputed land. I also confess that I had to shut my eyes in pain while in the late minutes of the movie because of an unprepared, depressing and melancholic scene! Everybody would know if they have watched the movie.Everyone did what they could but, Anupam Kher and Pallavi Joshi were exceptional. I could not focus on others specifically since, I wasn't seeing their performance rather, was feeling the unimaginable story of their characters!Hats off to the team for contributing brilliant documentation that was never archived before, bravo to all who were involved in making this!I really wish all those who were made refugees forcefully and had to go through those hard days of the holocaust, may return to their homes at the earliest.I lend my shoulder to the victims
I weep with them and
I stand with Kashmiri Pandits

GlobalRanger,13 March 2022,One of the most IMPORTANT films ever made in the history of Cinema...,"Synopsis: Based on one of the darkest chapters of India's *twisted* history, ""The Kashmir Files"" depicts the events (and contrasting narratives) surrounding the persecution, genocide & forced mass exodus endured by Kashmiri Pandits in their own homeland in 1990.Review: The research done for this film is meticulous, to say the least. With stark attention to detail, the Filmmaker has presented the events as they occured, and also provided a snapshot of some authentic news articles & TV interviews. While it's practically impossible to depict each & every occurance related to the forced exodus of half a million Kashmir Pandits within a single film, the scenarist has wisely chosen a narrative pattern that encapsulates the gist of the tragedy. The screenplay alternates between past & present, and you have to see the film to realize how much sense this narrative structure makes. We get to see the perspectives of the victims, the so called ""secular-liberals"", the pillars of Democracy, the terrorists, the Kashmiri Muslims and the confused youth of today. The Director also throws light on ""why & how"" these tragic events were whitewashed since more than three decades. Talking about the actors on screen, Anupam Kher has given his career best performance and lived his role to the hilt.. he is the soul of the film. Mithun Chakraborty, Pallavi Joshi, Darshan Kumar, Bhasha Sumbli, Prakash Belawadi, Puneet Issar, Atul Srivastav & Chinmay Mandlekar are all in top form. Even the extras seem to be seasoned actors and leave a mark in their limited screentime. The brooding background score aptly conveys the mood of every scene, and the cinematography is excellent. The dialogues & conversations are extremely evocative, and these are used as an essential device to make the audience aware of certain facts. Despite being made within a modest budget of Rs. 20 crores, the production values of this film are impeccable.There are well made films, and there are IMPORTANT films. The Kashmir Files is both - It is one of the most important films ever made in the history of Cinema. Hats off to Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri for his courage & conviction to bring this hard hitting true story to life. No amount of praise is high enough for his noble efforts.The past cannot be changed, but historical lies must never be taken to the grave or passed over to the next generation. If we as a society remain in denial of bitter truths, it may potentially lead us to bigger tragedies. Dark truths surely discomfort us when they emerge from the shadows, but they eventually lead us to our catharsis & salvation.Conclusion: Do yourselves a favour & watch this heart rending film.. It would be your acknowledgement of the horrific truths that were hushed & brushed under the carpet since the last 32 years by vested interests both within & outside our Nation. It would also be your tribute to those unfortunate Kashmiri Pandits who lost their family, their home, their identity, and ended up as refugees in their own country.This landmark film doesn't need my validation, but if I have to give a rating it would be: 11/10.",10/10,The Kashmir Files

sandeepbihani,11 March 2022,Goosebumps time,"I would say - why was such a movie not made earlier. Bollywood has lied all this time. We have been taught wrong history. Now when I will go to Kashmir, I will not be able to look into a Kashmiri Pandit's eyes. We as a nation have failed them. As a nation, we should apologise to them.God bless their beautiful souls for not becoming terrorists. Thank you Vivek and thank the talented cast for doing justice to the REAL story. They did not sell their soul to BollyKhans. Shame on them.

He has captured the brutality unleashed upon the Kashmiri Hindus in the 80s and 90s through an unfiltered lens. This movie drops you in a cauldron of raw and strong emotions and these emotions keep you engulfed throughout this movie. It took me sometime to gather myself and walk out of the theatre. It's a must watch movie for everyone especially youngsters. Hindu genocide in Kashmir is out in the world for everyone to see and everyone must support them.

But not to this depth. Appreciate the makers and the characters in this Movie, rather calling it movie this is True story like a mirror in front of about pandits.It is not about 500 or 1000 years ago mughal story who looted use, just around 30+ years back it is our own brother hood and neighbor ppl who did barbaric actions against the Hindus in valley.We still have Pallavi joshi like character between us, unless we clean them this type of incidents keeps happening.Kudos to the Entire Crew , not to worry about kapil sharma show (who has not invited this team on his show) or few cheap public stunt figures who are commenting negative on this. On bottom line you have reached us and we are with you.",10/10,The Kashmir Files

cifarshayar,3 September 2022,best love story of the year till now,"While watching Sita Ramam, Veer-Zara was coming to mind not because it was inspired from it or copying any aspect of that classic but because it is heart touching in the same way. We hardly see films on India-Pakistan without animosity Veer-Zara was one and so is Sita Ramam perhaps that was the reason Sita Ramam reminds me of SRK - PZ staring Veer Zara . One of the finest from Dulqar Salman and Mrunal too was treat to watch. There is not much for Rashmika Mandana but she too did good whatever was given to her. The narrative give you thrills of a suspense movie within a beautifully woven periodic love story and that credit goes to the director.

sayonbiz,5 October 2022,Nothing short of perfection!!,"Loved everything in the film from the cinematography to the music was PERFECT!! One should really appreciate how gracefully they presented a story of love.Not a lot of people can make such a movie without any cringefest dialogues and trendsetter songs in this day and age. So huge props to the movie makers for presentinf just the pure essence of love.Special mention of the colour palette of the movie as well - from the outfits to the props around, everything matched perfectly with each and every surrounding and looked soo good!! A huge fan of the music as well. I just wish I would have been able to check this movie out in the theatres.

capri_can-01644,4 September 2022,Worth Watching,"I watched this in theaters. I can onlybsay what a story and what beautiful characters and even more engaging acting by the lead pair. Such a simple movie with such high values. One kust watch this in theaters! Dont miss it. It is far better than huped bollywood cringe fests like laal singh chadda and brahmastra. Sita Ramam is a must watch!! The director makes sure the movie is well connected and keeps its audience engaged. I watched it here in USA and am going to take 2-3 more friends to watch it with me. However i will ask atleast 10 friends to not watch Brahmastra because whatever money we spend on tickets of Brahmastra will be used to fund Pakistan. Hence we will boycottBrahmastra and support Sita Ramam.Jai Hind.

m-ramanan,11 September 2022,"The theme involves POK, Kashmir, Ind Vs Pak hatred but it is still fell good for both sides","RATED 10/10
Language: Telugu
Source: Amazon Prime
RECOMMENDEDThe theme involves POK, Kashmir, Ind Vs Pak hatred, Hindu-Muslim sentiments and all possible controversial things. But everyone will get the feel good factor only from all these controversial things. This is the best thing and core reason for the success of this venture.One of the best movie for this year. To get the whole feel, you should watch this in big screen. Initially I thought the cast is bit odd for Telegu movie, but it is the best one. My suggestion watch it in Telugu version instead of the dubbed one.There is good amount of sentiment and romance throughout the movie. In fact my eyes got moist towards the end of the movie. I felt so tightened in my chest in this movie after ""96"".The movie flow is so feel good from the beginning. The climax was awesome and the twist gives the completely different meaning to the movie.",10/10,Sita Ramam

maruthuk-21470,11 September 2022,Superb Love Story,"First few minutes movie goes little slowly and picks up pace, which is maintained till the end. Although songs don't stay in the heart for too long, its visuals and lines make the audience glued to them, which is a big win for cinematographer and lyricist.Acting of Dulquer Salman and Mrunal Thakur is too good and at times felt like Mrunal Thakur is the hero of the movie, because of the weightage give her character and her excellent acting too. She looks too gorgeous in Sarees, probably she could become a heartthrob for many youngsters in the coming years!Although role of Rashmika is limited, she still has played her part.Probably it is one of the coolest love stories in the recent past and many love scenes flow like a cold breeze in the minds of audience!! Inspite of all the positives mentioned above, still felt like some logical mistakes are there, probably they are also due to the gaps in storytelling!",8/10,Sita Ramam
akhil027,15 September 2022,Heart touching love story,"Sita Ramam is quite beautiful despite its flaws. Every single instance in this movie doesn't work, but the ones that does work, works very well.It has the old school charming romance between two strangers who meets through letters and fate. Best thing about Sita Ramam is the performances by both of the lead actors. Mrunal Thakur is not an addition to the list of pretty faces. She can act too. Dulquer is simply one of the most charming actor in the country. Such roles are his strong suit and he owns it.The rest of the cast is pretty overdramatic or bad.Almost all the emotional and romantic scenes are great, while the rest of the scenes felt meh. A huge credit in the movie's success goes to the music director who did a fine job with the songs and background score.The forced religious harmony was unnecessary. Like the scene in which the guy from the embassy and the soldier says Jai Sriram and Allahu Akbar. Also, there is one guy who keeps saying ""what a love story"" so many times. It was a poor move by the film maker.Rashmika's character had some potential but ended up as a wasted opportunity.

mangalamitash,29 October 2022,"Made with love, for love.","You almost feel like watching Veer-Zaara as soon as this movie ends.An Indian army major saving a princess carrying the weight of expectations of her grandparents wishes. The sacrifice and an unprecedented love, the wait for eternity, that transcends caste, society and even borders, so many parallels.For the generation that has grown with Veer-Zaara, this is a sort of tribute to it to. Not the scale and larger than life protagonists, but with all the beauty and soul.Sita Ramam is a beautiful movie, that takes time to engage the audience into the worlds of Ram and Sita. Set in 60s and 80s, where the feeling of love was more about the anticipation, of small things like talking over landline phone, waiting to meet, chasing your crush (not digital stalking), almost makes you wonder what is that technology has added to in our lives, rather than taking away. While the names Sita and Ram do blend it by interval and you feel like destiny playing its part to make the two meet, the movie imo did not completely justify using these names and I do not know where it moved away from that to a delivering a more diplomatic stance. The name Noorjahan (real name of Sita) is completely lost by end of the movie, while making sense, the movie did not completely transition into it. May be the times we live don't allow us another ""Veer"" meeting ""Zaara"".Best works for Dalqueer and Mrunal so far I am sure and will go down in their books as a milestone film in their careers.Took one point away for the end. I know what the director was trying to do and clear the stain on Ram, though felt it was not required. We must not forget that HE is our protector and not the other way round. But then again, such are the times we live in where we feel the need to protect even his portrayals.",9/10,Sita Ramam

SAMTHEBESTEST,2 September 2022,Dulquer Salmaan & Mrunal Thakur's Modern Version Of Veer Zaara Will Make You Fall In Love Again.,"Sita Ramam (2022) :
Movie Review -Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur play the romantic couple in Hanu Raghavapudi's period romantic drama, ""Sita Ramam."" Telugu cinema is aware of Yash Chopra's cult romantic tale, ""Veer Zaara,"" and has tried to give it a competition with Sita Ramam. So Dulquer Salmaan is Shah Rukh Khan, Mrunal Thakur is Preity Zinta, Rashmika Mandanna is Rani Mukerji with a twist, and I am not sure who actually plays the part of Manoj Bajpayee. Well, that's it. You get most of the ideas from these comparisons that will surely excite you for the film. Sita Ramam is all about love, emotions, bonding, and sacrifice, with a fantastic touch of patriotism and India vs Pakistan relations. Veer Zaara also had everything mentioned above, but it had a happy ending which Sita Ramam doesn't have. Oh my god, did I just give a big spoiler? Wait, let me rectify my mistake. So, Sita Ramam has a happy ending too, but in a different zone. It's not a regular happy ending. Hanu Raghavapudi's period romantic drama lives up to the hype and delivers what's promised and what was expected.Sita Ramam is about Ram (Dulquer Salmaan), an orphan and an Indian Army officer, who falls in love with Sita (Mrunal Thakur). Does Sita have anything to hide from him? You'll get answers in the film. The love birds are divided, and now a Pakistani girl, Aafrin (Rashmika Mandanna), is on the mission of finding the whereabouts of Sita to deliver one of Ram's letters. During the journey, Aafrin, who initially hates India and Indians, learns about some shocking events from the past, and evolves around them. Now desperate to meet Sita and Ram, will Aafrin find it then? That's all you get to see in Sita Ramam.The performances of all the leading cast members are fine in the film. Dulquer Salmaan doesn't have the image of a romantic boy like SRK. Instead, he is known for his versatility. That's what he does here too. Dulquer looks handsome, cute and innocent, and you fall in love with the kind of man he is. His acting has several aspects, and he fulfils almost every criteria in the film. On the other hand, Mrunal Thakur looks no less than an angel. Such a breathtaking beauty! You'll fall in love with her instantly. Has she ever looked so gorgeous in any film? I doubt it. The second lady, Rashmika, is known for her beautiful face and is hailed as a national crush. So how can she go wrong with this kind of role? Not just the leading trio, but the supporting cast has also done a nice job here. Tharun Bhascker, Sumanth, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Vennela Kishore, Sachin Khedekar, Jisshu Sengupta, Bhumika Chawla, and others have done well in their roles.Sita Ramam has a very good storyline that offers a fulfilling and emotional romantic tale. However, it takes long 160 minutes to do it, which wasn't really needed. The songs make it a longer film, but all the songs worked perfectly in those situations. And what are romantic films without songs in India? Nothing. So it had to be there. But does that bore you or waste your time? I'd say, No. The screenplay could've trimmed a few scenes and shortened the length, but by the time you reach the climax, you forget about the long journey you had till that time. The cinematography is spectacular in the songs. Those icy mountains, that palace, Kashmir's border and other locations add to your viewing experience in the same amount as what is expected from a period film.Hanu Raghavapudi's vision to look at things from a romantic point of view really boosts the essence of Sita Ramam. After all, a romantic drama is entitled to have something filmy, and yet he makes his points very clear while exploring the narrative. His storytelling is a bit outdated, but as we know, romance is like old wine. The taste just gets better and better by the time. Those two-decade old formulas of Veer Zaara have become a part of nostalgia, and Sita Ramam awakens all of them beautifully. The film has more variety and conflicts, which only add to your interest. If you are missing those pure romantic dramas from the bygone days, then watch Sita Ramam to relive the golden phase of romance again in 2022. As a whole, Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur's modern version of Veer Zaara will make you fall in love again.RATING - 7/10*",7/10,Sita Ramam
OnjiMooteDaMarle,13 September 2022,A Poem of Excellence in Cinema,"This 2 hours and 40+ minutes cinema is what actually cinema should be. Everything from the story, the screenplay, acting, direction, music (aaha), cinematography, locations, costumes, art, etc have been so good, so well done that the film's length doesn't make you wonder about its longevity. It is no short of a wonder. The story though starts off as a simple goal with ulterior motives for an Afreen, drives her to tell us about the characters Ram and Sita. The film steals the show in its subtleness and it's era of love, keeping every old charm alive. The music is simply soothing while the locations add to the beauty of it. The film never bored me at any point in time and is definitely watchable with family. It's worth every minute of those 160 minutes. Available on Prime in Telugu, Tamil & Malayalam.

VineethGvs,5 August 2022,Classic!!!!,"Just watched the movie in the theatre. Can't stop thinking about it after coming out. At a time period where love story in a movie is only about unnecessary romantic scenes and few songs, this film surely stands out. Future love story films will surely be gauged against this film to be named as a classic love story.

its_me_rajit,12 November 2022,A potentially good script over simplified,"Like other dulquer's movie this is also handling lot of plots altogether. The love story, patriotism, the anti pakistani angle, spy stories. Ram is played by dulquer and story revolves around him.Whenever the Indian movie tries to show the patriotic movie they go over the top showing the Indian armies heroism and Pakistanis as sole villains.nothing in between , no gray characters . This also suffers from the same flaw and because of that it is very difficult to connect with the character . Because they are flat. Because they are linear and that's not what non Indian cinema lovers want to see. Too simplified.Sita mostly look beautiful and that's the sole thing she does. A simplified character , which had the great potential of being layered because she is hiding some truths.A potentially good script over simplified.",6/10,Sita Ramam

nidhunmoviebuff,15 August 2022,A disarmingly charming romantic epic that will steal your heart!,"Dulquer Salmaan has pretty much exhausted all the lover-boy tropes and cinematic cliches in his short but substantial filmography, from the college kid finding his way in life in films like ""Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi (2013)"" to the more worldly, commitment-phobe in ""OK Kanmani (2015)"" and it has seemed like he is playing the same characters over and over again in recent projects. So it is with much trepidation and lack of any expectation that I heard the announcement of yet another romance drama with the young scion of Mollywood in the lead, that too in Telugu.The man, however, seems to thrive on throwing conventions and expectations to the wind, combining forces with director Hanu Raghavapudi and two charming leading ladies to deliver one of the most gut-wrenching romantic tales of the year, that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. The period story set against the backdrop of war and terrorism, immaculate production design, colorful costumes, combined with an intrepid lead romantic pairing make ""Sita Ramam"" the perfect concoction of romance that the box office has been missing for some time.Rashmika Mandanna stars as ""Afreen"" a cynical, rebellious Pakistani teenager in 1980s London, tasked by her grandfather on his deathbed to return a mysterious letter to an Indian lady who he was never able to locate during his dying days. As the stubborn youngster starts her search for the peculiar person named ""Sita Mahalakshmi"" (Mrunal Thakur) addressed in the letter, she uncovers more clues that unravel her story as well as that of her dashing lover, ""Lieutenant Ram"" (Dulquer) and their star-crossed romance during the war-ravaged 1960s in Kashmir. While the first half gets sluggish and boring in places, the second half reveals that these initial set-up scenes were crucial to complete the intricate character arcs of our three principal protagonists.Director Hari Raghavapudi and cinematographer PS Vinod spare no detail in capturing the scenic beauty and natural aesthetic of Kashmir and the stirring songs rendered by Vishal Chandrasekhar become the cherry on top, propelling the love story to another plane altogether. Dulquer Salmaan's natural disarming charm and Mrunal Thakur's grace and elegance make a devastating pairing, one you will instinctively find yourself rooting for from their first scene together. I am especially glad that the capable actor in Rashmika Mandanna finally got a fully-fleshed out role that showcased her undeniable talent, that of the stubborn, ambitious but flawed ""Afreen"".""Sita Ramam"" is the epic love story the industry has been desperately missing for a long time and it is curious that it is Tollywood that keeps churning out these innovative romance flicks, at least recently, be it the heartwarming musical ""Love Story (2021)"" or the more grandiose ""Shyam Singha Roy (2021)"". Take a bow Hanu Raghavapudi and team for mounting a project of such scale, vision, production value, and strong writing and for telling us a universally appealing story in such an emotionally touching way. Embrace this magnum-opus in theatres to experience the emotion that is Sita Ramam. This movie will stay with me for a long time. Highly recommended!",8/10,Sita Ramam

SoumikBanerjee25,24 September 2022,"It didn't work for me in a way, like it did for so many others","I am not fond of romantic features, I do not detest them nor do I put them on the pedestal but I do position them relatively lower in the pecking order. Even though, I happen to stumble upon such works quite often.Initially, I didn't have any plans whatsoever to watch 'Sita-Ramam'; but for the last few days, an array of encouraging reviews coming from literally all corners of the country convinced me otherwise. And therefore, I made up my mind and finally decided to jump on the bandwagon.And now, I feel regret.I mean no disrespect, and I'm in no shape and form ridiculing other people's preferences but I do wonder why so many people felt a profound connection whereas I could not, despite my frantic attempts. Leaving out the technical expertise, music, and the lead pair's (Dulqueer & Mrunal) ceaseless charm, I find this one to be nothing but a meandering affair at best.It just didn't work for me, and bear in mind, that has nothing to do with my lack of affection for Romance, make no mistake, I can and I will forever appreciate a good film, no matter what! But the harsh reality is it is not a good film, at least it is not from my perspective, according to my taste.Usually, I don't like to bring up unwarranted comparisons, but here I'm making an exception by comparing this to a movie that came out last year from the same industry (Telugu) i.e. Shyam Singha Roy! Even if the core notions are slightly different, various bits of the screenplay did share some uncanny resemblances (The romantic set-up, ending closure, etc)And I will say this, that was a much better execution, yes, it had its own set of issues, correct, but on the whole, it was a movie that made me fall in love with the lead couple (Nani & Sai Pallavi) as well as with the characters they played respectively. I wish this had a matching impact, alas! That didn't happen.",4/10,Sita Ramam
vaishalikamath-40648,19 September 2022,I wanted to like it but I couldn't.,"The story has a good germ. The star cast is impressive. Dulquer is in his comfort zone. Mrunal looks fresh and attractive. Some experienced character actors can be seen e.g. Neeraj Kabi, Gautham Menon, Tinnu Anand. Every frame is poster material. Literally, every frame. Also, Mrunal's sarees are gorgeous and the blouses worth copying. :DYet, the film did not manage to keep me captivated. :( :( I wanted to like it but I could not.Firstly, the length is unnecessary. The film drags in several places. At least two songs had to be cut down. Thematically, they are repetitive. Also, some comedy scenes are superfluous.Secondly, some questions remain unanswered. Why does an army officer, who's posted at the border in Kashmir, start and continue exchange of letters with an unknown person? And why does he go looking for 'her'? Was that not risky? S/he could've been a spy.Also, when she meets Dulquer's character for the first time, why has Mrunal's character gone to Kashmir? For photography? If that's her hobby, how come there's no mention of it later?Plus, why did Abu Tariq not deliver the letter earlier?If Rashmika's character has grown up in Abu Tariq's family, how does she come to hate India?I found several loose ends in the movie. The direction is somewhat amateurish. Although I am a fan of Dulquer, I want to see him in different roles now. Most of the character actors, too, are wasted, I feel.All in all, I don't see myself watching this movie again. :( If I have the strong urge to watch a Dulquer movie, I'll watch 'Charlie' instead.PS: I watched Sita Ramam in Malayalam, with subtitles.",5/10,Sita Ramam
JPEI64,23 September 2022,Nothing great,"Seriously?Interesting storyline heavily compromised by catering to superstars. Everything looks and appears staged. Acting is mediocre, with stilted dialogues, cringeworthy action and stereotyped characters. Nothing in the movie makes a powerful impact or create any emotions. Weak continuity and terrible directing add to the mess. The movie is ridiculously preachy to the extent of being embarassing. The lead characters looking good, perfect make up and poise. Amateur work at best and a waste of time.DS looks extremely uncomfortable and Rashmika is definitely not an actress by any stretch of imagination.Or have I seen the wrong movie?

ahammadkabeermb,10 September 2022,A perfect classic romantic movie,"Its one of those perfect not happy ending romantic Drama which touches your heart. The romance between Ram and Sita(Noor jahan) was epic and the names they have chosen for each character was well thought through. The BGM makes the movie more emotional and close to heart.Sometime it is not meant be together but to love in the memories we created, Ram and Sita(Noor) romance will live longer.Each actors played their role wonderfully and appreciate how Dulqer Salman played the role of Ram. Rashmika did wonderful by showcasing an young angry pakistani women but someone realise the trueth later- love wins over hatred.Mrinal casting was apt for a princess and for Sita, her presence was amazing.

TharsheyN,22 October 2022,A love story that breaks all boundaries!,"Sita Ramam is a beautiful movie, which follows the life of a orphan soldier from the Indian army, Ram. Ram is compassionate and tries to save lives rather then take them. He serves on the Kashmir border and that's where during a conflict with some terrorists and angry citizens he saves the life of Princess Noor Jahan. He doesn't get a chance to see her properly or find out about who she was. However he does stop the conflict from escalating without any bloodshed or death.Later the heroic actions of Ram and his squad are reported on the Indian news, including the fact that Ram is an orphan. What follows is many Indians around India send Ram letters claiming to be family members. From brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles to Sita Mahalakshmi who claims to be his wife. Her letter is also the only one without a return address.What follows is Ram's attempts to find her and eventually meet her and the love that blooms, develops and grows between them. What he doesn't know throughout nearly the entire movie is that Sita Mahalakshmi is actually Princess Noor Jahan. He instead thinks that she is a dance teacher at the palace who is teaching Bharatanatyam to the princess. She goes by the alias Sita Mahalakshmi or Sita for short when around Ram. Problems arise when her brother takes over 60 Crores loss of property and assets due to the Sultan of Oman seizing all assets in the country. The only way to recover is for Princees Noor Jahan to marry the Sultans son the Prince of Oman and tie their two families together. Sita however has fallen in love with a common man, a Indian soldier named Ram serving on the Kashmir border with a monthly salary of 600 Rupees.Sita Ramam follows the love story between Ram and Sita from their first meeting to Ram's eventual marriage proposal and Noor Jahan giving up her title of Princess, her palace and all her wealth to be with Ram. They get a happy few weeks together and on the day that Sita wants to reveal who she really is to Ram he is given a secret mission with his squad to infiltrate and eliminate the terrorist Ansari. Ram will never see Sita/Noor Jahan again.The mission is carried out without issue but as they're leaving the cries of a little girl Waheeda in the burning house causes compassionate Ram to turn back go into the burning building and save her which leads to him and Vishnu, another soldier, being captured by the Pakistan army. Brigadier Abu Tariq from the Pakistan army works out a prisoner exchange deal, to swop Ram and Vishnu in return for a Pakistan officer. However things don't go exactly the way it was planned as Pakistan is only willing to swop 1 of their prisoners. Ram being the kind, compassionate and caring person that he his puts his own love and feelings aside so that Vishnu can return to his family in India rather then him. Pakistan want one more thing, the location of Indian army bases. Vishnu gives in to blackmail and tells them everything while Ram stands strong. However Vishnu is released and the blame for the base locations being leaked is pinned on Ram whose branded a traitor.Ram writes a letter which he gives to Brigadier Abu Tariq, who has adopted Waheeda as his granddaughter, to deliver. Minutes later Ram is executed. Brigadier Abu Tariq tries in vain to deliver Ram's letter to Sita Mahalakshmi at the Noor Jahan palace. 20 years later Brigadier Abu Tariq has passed away and before his granddaughter Afreen can claim all his assets she has to deliver a letter to Sita Mahalakshmi. In his last letter to Afreen he writes that it's a debt that needs to be repayed. Afreen sets out on a journey to find Sita Mahalakshmi and deliver the letter. Along the way she learns about Ram and Sita, who she soon realizes is actually the Nawab of Hyderabad. She comes across Vishnu who wants to stop the letter being delivered for fear that it may implicate him selling out his country.The letter gets delivered by a friend of Afreen's who has been helping her throughout her journey. Princess Noor Jahan who now goes by Sita Mahalakshmi gets to read the last words written to her from the love of her life Ram. With Afreen as witness and the letter from Ram, Noor Jahan/Sita launches an investigation against Vishnu Sharma (Ram's soldier friend who betrayed him and the country) who kills himself with his service revolver.The movie ends with Sita and Afreen hugging one another. Along with the letter, Sita received a newspaper clipping with the title "" Princess Noor Jahan of Hyderabad being in love with a common man"" which means that at some point Ram had found out who she really was, that she was the Nawab of Hyderbad and a Muslim, but didn't care and continued to love her, even more if anything, to give up her status and wealth for him. Afreen also finds out from Vishnu Sharma during her journey that she is Waheeda, the girl Ram had saved from being burned alive and who had caused him to be caught by the Pakistan army.Sita Ramam, a story about love between a common Indian soldier and the Princess Of Hyderabad. About a man who saved a little girl from Pakistan and who lost his life and the chance to see or touch the love of his life ever again. It's narrated from the year 1985 through Afreen's eyes with flashbacks showing you Ram and Noor's meeting etc and everything that occured in 1965. It is a beautiful, well directed movie that shows love breaks down all boundaries, love transcends all. Even 20 years after Ram's death, Noor Jahan/Sita still loves Ram with all her heart and with the help of Afreen proves Ram's innocence and restore his name and honour in the Indian army. She also accepts his honours from the army as his wife.The cast is truly amazing as well, with Dulquer Salmaan who plays Lt. Ram delivering an award winning performance. Mrunal Thakur plays Princess Noor Jahan/Sita Mahalakshmi and looks absolutely stunning while delivering the performance of a life time. Together Dulquer and Mrunal steal the show with their superb acting, looks and on-screen chemistry. Rashmika Mandanna also does a good job in her role as Waheeda/Afreen. The casting was just perfect for the movie, with Dulquer and Mrunal really bringing their characters to life on screen and making them feel like real people to the viewer. I nearly teared up at the ending...I will end this review by saying that Sita Ramam deserves a 10/10 in all respects, however I can only bring myself to give it a 9/10 at most, because of that ending. I can't give it a 10/10 when I see that ending and know that Ram and Sita never got to see each other again or be together. They never got to spend the rest of their lives with one another. If I was Ram I would have fought tooth and nail to be the one sent back to India, or sad as it is to say, I wouldn't have gone back into that burning house to rescue Waheeda. My mind would have been focused on escape and getting back to Sita. If it wasn't for him saving Waheeda, instead of Sita/Noor being alone for 20 years by the time 1985 comes along, she and Ram would have been married and living happily for the last 20 years, probably even had little princes and princesses of their own at that point. Ram is a much better man then me, I would have thought of myself and my Sita first and foremost, rather then thinking of a innocent little girl or the family of my fellow soldier(who turned out to be a spineless traitor). So 9/10 from me, Sita Ramam is what cinema is all about, give it a watch, enjoy it and be ready with your tissues for the ending.",9/10,Sita Ramam
sreekarnumars,6 August 2022,Epic Love Story,"A love story like no other movie in recent times. Mrunal thakur stole the show with her elegance,screen presence,acting and with her beauty.

jay-techie2007,17 December 2022,Definitely Watch It - Slow to Begin but You Won't Regret,"The movie was recommended by my friends from South and I had heard a bit, positive reviews, on the internet. So I finally watched it on Hotstar. It has somewhat a slow pace but one can think of it as a slow cooked delicacy that's worth the patience.The plot is amazing. The storyline is woven beautifully. The characters, at least the main ones, are well written. Mid-way it sort of reminded us of Veer-Zara but it doesn't turn out to be that. Definitely makes you emotional though.Kudos to the performances of Dulquer Salman and Mrunal Thakur. The other actors also did great.The movie is amazing artistically - great work by the art director. The backgrounds, the locations, the costumes - a treat to watch. They could have speed up the movie a bit - that's the only improvement I think was needed.But otherwise a great watch!!",9/10,Sita Ramam

opotraining,25 September 2022,It's Just OK movie,The love story is average and nothing special in this movie. Love stories blooming over letters were already there before and are much better. This one was pretty lame. As usual the hero is good with everyone. He stops a riot with his speech without any weapons with is totally unrealistic. The hero who is very good officer easily gets distracted after reading love letters. He even goes in search of the women after reading letters. He easily meets the women who was writing him letters and there was no suspense at all. Sitamahalxmi is a princess from royal family but roams alone without any security. Ram and Sitamahalaxmi always look fresh in all scene with full makeup and perfect hairs. This movie has shown that there are good army officers in pakistan and nobody has any problem with it. The climax was very funny and rushed. They just belive the contents of letter after 20 years.Rashmika is such a bad actor and total waste in this movie. DS as ram was very good and loved his style. MT as sita was very average and her expression were same for entire movie. The chemistry of both actors were average. Unwanted comedy scenes are added in between.,5/10,Sita Ramam
kainatrc,24 September 2022,Superhit movie,"This is one the finest love story I have ever watched. It has become so tough for me to weave words to write about it. The story is narrated in such a beautiful way,not like any movie where only one person narrates the complete story but instead it is narrated by different person at different places .And at the same time the story continues without losing its flow .This is such a cute and sweet and pure that audience connects with it instantly in no time. Watched it on amazon with English subtitles waiting for the hindi version. Mrunal looks so elegant may be the best look and the best acting of her career. Rashmika too looked awesome in her natural look. Dulquer Salman is slso amazing in his army officer look. Overall it's a 10/10 movie. I am sure it's a complete family entertainer.

bvnisarga,14 September 2022,A love story for the ages.,"Dulquer Salman captures your heart as Ram and refuses to let it go, Mrunal Thakur is lovely as Sita and intrigues you with her eyes.Ram and Sita's romance is lively and lovely with an innocence and charm which is hard to find. Ram and Sita are just magic together.The screenplay hooks you in with it's non-linear narrative,The songs are beautiful, the cinematography stunning and the dialogues are charming.The story will take you on an emotional roller-coaster (cliche I know).My heart is full after watching this movie, it made me happy and yet feel wretched at the same time.It truly is a love story for the ages.",9/10,Sita Ramam
cinemapichollu,10 August 2022,A Vintage Love Story Reminding Us of Mani Ratnam Days,"Director Hanu Raghavapudi has definitely created a classic love story with Sita Ramam. Despite having read an important part of the climax it had the same impact making me cry a little. I loved the nostalgia it created and it felt a little reminiscent of Mani Ratnam's love stories in a good way.I heard some calling it predictable but that's the wrong word, it's slightly familiar. Story is not the most unique or unpredictable it has slight hints but it's not very predictable either and all the emotional moments still landed for me at least. The familiarity was utilized well to create a filling of nostalgia especially for those who love some classic love stories from the Golden Age of Indian Cinema in the 90s. Sometimes a story with a hint of familiarity can be truly taken to the next level with proper writing, performances, and taking. The movie still goes in a very unique way with an interesting screenplay which is a tad reminiscent of Mahanati's VD-Sam setup but works really well in this case and it's all tied together in a beautiful way.The movie is truly beautiful and is setup in a seeminly poetic manner, and the screenplay and twists landed so well. The movie managed to show the friction between Hindus and Muslims with such a poetic and unbiased light without putting either religion down. Kudos to the director for achieving that feat without getting unnecessary controversies and showing all as equal in the end. Some people complained about the movie being a little slow but I didn't have that problem, I was extremely immersed and even forgot to eat the snacks I brought.Dulqueer Salmaan is really good in the role and extremely charismatic which the movie calls for and I can't think anyone else who balances that charisma and the emotional notes that well. Mrunal maintains the same level of charisma and holds the emotional beats so well making this movie feel more poetic. I can't imagine a single other person in the roles of Ram and Seetha. Sumanth surprised me with his performance and the character in general made me dislike him and sympathize with him in an odd way. Tharun Bascker was fun to watch and Rashmika was another surprise with how well she performed and her character design was done really well.Overall a really beautiful movie with great taking which is making me sure that Hanu overcame all his problems with previous films to make a vintage love story which I hope stands the test of time.",9/10,Sita Ramam

Set in the backdrop of terrorist operations in Kashmir, and what happens to the lovers forms the crux of the story.The direction by Hanu and the story mesmerises you and keeps you hooked till the end. Its one of those rare love stories hich is executed well and keeps your interests till the end.The music and background sscore is a plus. The cinematography and picturisation of Kasmir is superb and a treat to watch.Dulquer as Lt Ram is excellent and breathes life into every frame he is part of. He lives the role of Lt Ram and this would be one of his finest performances till date.Mrunal Thakur as Sita looks gorgeous and it is difficult to take your eyes off her. She gives a powerful nuanced peformance going through all the emotions. Her ability to convey emotions with her expressive eyes lifts the character of Sita to a different level. One of her best perfrmance till date.Another thing that works for the movie is the chemistry between Dulquer & Mrunal.Rashmika is good as Afreen is good and so are all the other supporting cast.",9/10,Sita Ramam

chiragjan,11 December 2022,Literally one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.,"I don't have words to express my emotions after this movie, started with a lot of expectations after hearing the reviews but it was more than that. The film kills in every department of film making, let it be story, direction, camera work and need not to say about acting. Hat's off to the makers of this film. I recommend it to EVERYONE. It's one of a kind mindful love story. Although I feel Dulquer Salmaan acts the same in all his movies but his script selection is on another level, I'm his fan now. And Mrunal Thakur just looked fabulous that till the movie ends you'll start loving her, and the way she acted, I dare you to not admire her.

shashanksomayaji,29 August 2022,What a waste of two good characters!,"They had two good characters in hand, but they chose to waste them with unwanted agenda peddling and appeasement. Could have been a simple yet great love story without the condescending Bollywood type preaching in matters that doesn't concern the love story at all. Taking liberty of undermining Indian army (but appeasing the Pakistani army) in order to glorify your lead characters is just unacceptable. This preaching attitude of directors and writers is ruining the movie experience off late. People who do not know about Kashmir shouldn't venture to show their version of ""truth"", specially when the movie doesn't need that narrative for it's purpose.Making is also not that great with harsh transitions between scenes. Except the lead characters, all other characters are non relatable and less believable. Rashmika continues to be ordinary on screen. Only saving grace is probably the music.All the positive reviews are either paid or biased. I've definitely seen much better movies from the same industry.",4/10,Sita Ramam
indianature,11 September 2022,Gripping Romance But More Than Just A Love Story,"I watched Sita Ramam last night on Primevideo in orig. Telugu w/Eng. Subs.Initially the film appeared to be a typical fantasy musical romance like many others of this genre, but the story is much more than that and it was gripping till the very end.The film begins in London where Afreen (Rashmika Mandana) an aggressive student activist of Pak origin who hates Indians is compelled as a condition to claim her inheritance from her Pak army grandfather Maj. Abu Tarik (Sachin Khedekar), to travel to Hyderabad to deliver a 20 year old undelivered letter written by a long missing Indian Army person Ram (Dulquer Salman) to his wife Sitamahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur). But there is no address for Sita and Afreen must take the help of Balaji (Tharun Bhasker) to trace Ram's former Army colleagues and staff in the erstwhile palace of Princess Noor Jehan to execute her mission.No Further Spoilers .. its a new film and definitely worth watching .. so watch this film to see how the narration plays out.The music by Vishal Chandrasekharan is quite good, the cinematography and locations are beautiful. Its a big budget movies so there are also some songs shot inexplicably in Gujarat in what certainly seems to be the fabulous UNESCO Rani Ni Vav Queen's Stepwell in Patan, and in the pond of the exquisite Modhera Temple. Every actor has convincingly portrayed their respective character, there are a few gut wrenching and poignant moments, the storyline succeeds in going beyond the much cliched Ind Pak hyped hate filled dramatisations that several other films propound. Sita Ramam is not about this, but more about the love between two individuals caught in unfortunate circumstances of their time. Much of the film is shot in well constructed flashback and period mode.Could have been half an hour shorter.",9/10,Sita Ramam
prince_c3,5 October 2022,Beautiful Love Story with Beautiful Kashmir as backdrop,"Well, first of all, this might be a bit long review, I usually don't leave long reviews, but I am compelled for this movie.The most important thing about this movie is if one understands received two kinds of hatred and I will explain it as we go, so please read on.Both hatred received by Hindu extremist and right wing Nationalist.All the reviews of one, two, three stars are from them.The First kind of Hatred because the director and writer Hanu Raghavapudi tried to show the truth about Kashmir.Second kind, from same Hindu terrorists, in Today's India boycotting anything, which has Muslim name to it, so these Hindu extremist giving deliberate negative reviews because the lead character Ram played by a Muslim actor Dulquer Salmaan and that's why majority negative review, since they can't openly said anything about it or about his brilliant acting to be honest he carried entire movie on his shoulders.I am from Kashmir and I grow up in 80s and 90s and unlike the Fake Movie Kashmir files made by Hindu terrorist and Nationalist, this movie touches few sensitive elements of Kashmir and these days in India, where Hindu nationalist wouldn't allow any movie, any TV series to show the truth about Kashmir, but bravo to writer and Director Hanu Raghavapudi tried to show the truth and reality of Indian army atrocities of killing minors, raping minor girls in front of their parents and forcing brothers to rape their sisters which of course you won't see anywhere.The lead characters of Ram and Sita played by Dulquer Salmaan and. Mrunal Thakur were brilliant.Having said that, the movie was not without flaws like every movie this movie had few flaws, like Rashmika Mandanna overacting. Some melodrama which is fine that goes with the story, the movie dragged a little bit, the editor could have done a better job.Overall, a solid 7 star movie, so question is why I gave 9 stars, to be honest to counter the Hindu extremist hatred I had to bump to 9 stars.Go and watch the movie, it's beautiful with awesome cinematography and beautiful acting and chemistry between Dulquer Salmaan & Mrunal Thakur. Mrunal Thaukar really looked beautiful and she did an awesome job for Sita.",9/10,Sita Ramam
Mangalassery_Neelakandan,10 September 2022,Beautiful Love Story but...,"Sita Ramam is about the love story of the titular characters. It is told or shown to us as a period romantic drama. It has references of Ramayana throughout and tries to portray the story in a different way and time period. Dulqueer and Mrunal has a great chemistry between and i enjoyed every moments they were together. But there are lot of cringe scenes through out but it is necessary for the story and with out it the movie would not move further. But taking the fact that in those period of time I don't know for sure but it could have happened like shown in the movie, for instance Ram gets a letter from a women she writes he is her brother and should come and name her daughter and she send some snacks.But the problem with me is that I am a person who sees movies for entertainment, and i like a happily ever after ending. I couldn't accept the fact that Sita and Ram are not united by the end. Matter of fact I don't like how ""Chitram"" ends so i have an alternative ending for that movie according to my imagination where the two meet again. So from my POV I would have liked Sita and Ram living a happy life together. I accept the fact that she proved Ram is not a traitor and got him his redemption but for me an alternative ending would be, Ram somehow was still alive and finding out that he was not a traitor our government makes a deed and brings him back to India and the two unites.For me after watching the movie it felt like a beautiful love story but I still like the pair being united at the end.",8/10,Sita Ramam

thefilmophile,19 August 2022,"Sita Ramam - A Millennium old classic love story, relived","There's always a Ram for a Sita, but trust me, the plot of this film is a little quirky. It feels like what if something happens like this in real life. I love how the evolution goes from Ram coming after Sita and now Sita coming after Ram. A love story like no other in recent times. Mrunal Thankur as Sita a.k.a Noor Jahaan stole the show. Her beauty, her elegance is just adorable. The reason I liked this movie is that, director followed the K. I. S. S algorithm i.e Keep It Simple Stupid. There were no unnecessary VFX or unique camera angles or different set locations. I felt some sort of purity, in this poetic story line. Definitely a one time watchable movie. I'm giving this 8 because it was not that perfect, the only VFX the movie had was the element of Fire which did not meet the expectation of realism. And a few camera cuts were a little off. But apart from that, you have to atleast once check out this.Some love stories deserve a poem, Some movies deserve a big screen. #SitaRamam.

bloomquick,16 November 2022,No words. Simply touched by this movie,"I don't think I will ever watch this movie again. Not because it's not worth, but because it stays with you, long after the credits. Have you ever felt dazed looking at a temple lit with a thousand lamps in the middle of darkness? This movie gives you that vibe. Tbh, I didn't give this movie a second thought even when media was abuzz with excitement. The posters also looked great, but somehow it didn't nudge me to watch it. But rarely does my brother recommend a movie. He said it once. Twice. Then again today, adding"" Don't cry"". Now I had to watch, almost challenging myself, even laughing at the thought of my brother in tears watching a movie. And boy was I hooked! As beautiful and pure as the Divine itself. It will linger. It will pull at your heart strings. And yet it will leave you with a smile in your very being. I don't think I have ever given a 10 for any movie. This movie deserves no less. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for a wonderful movie experience.

sibsaurabh,17 September 2022,Mindblowing must match,"South cinema has surpassed Bollywood in every aspect, such a masterpiece of a movie for just a mere budget of 30 crores. Story, Acting, Cinematography everything was top notch in this movie. What a beautiful way to show a love story and not feeling cringed even for a minute in the whole film. I will suggest everyone to just watch this spectacular movie. This movie is just class apart not your regular cringe love story. This movie shows a beautiful story without any adult scenes and can be watched with the family. Backdrop of war, terrorism in Kashmir, spying everything was very masterfully integrated with the story. You feel like you have been transported to the 60's and 80's.

vkp-43384,17 September 2022,It's very emotional full movie,"Epic Epic Epic üíû
Golly I'm lost for words as I didn't expect the Hanu Raghavapudi directed DQ, Mrunal and Rashmika starrer Sita Ramam to be such a beautiful and poignant love story. It's better than Ok Kanmani and Charlie combined, take it from me üòÅ. I think what works for the film beyond the grand scale at which it's mounted is how lovable the central characters are. Their chemistry sizzles and they both sparkle on screen, so everything around them naturally becomes appealing. From the moment Rashmika, who plays an extended cameo, decides to take the plunge and help herself by helping Ram and Sita, we know Sita Ramam could become everything that Radhe Shyam promised. Each frame is like a therapy for sore eyes, such is the brilliant cinematography. Although the songs are just hummable, the BGM is truly soul stirring and there are so many epic moments in both halves that I probably need to watch this film again just to revel in them. Hanu had given a flop in his previous film Padi Padi Lechu Manasu, which although was good, was also a little overdone. So credit to DQ and Mrunal for trusting the maker in him and giving us such a poetic love story. There is also a very intelligently woven subplot featuring the fight against Pak supported Mujhahideen. The cowardice of the countries that decided to ban the film is truly astonishing though. About the lead pair: Mrunal is gorgeous and her costume designer deserves every accolade in the book. She slips into the role of Sita so easily that you really can't take your eyes off her. Dulquer brings his career best performance in the role of soldier Ram and his honest performance will leave many teary eyed. I thought he's going through an identity crisis of sorts but hell no, Sita Ramam is the best decision he's made till date. The fact that its Malayalam version was almost full in a theatre in London and that the film's growing organically among the buffs, show there's something there. Sita Ramam is not just another love story, it's an emotional, epic and eternal tale of unanswered and unfulfilled love that's sure to last the test of times and leave everyone watching, supremely satisfied.",10/10,Sita Ramam

indeevar,12 August 2022,DULQUER fantasia MRUNAL regalia,"Movies are forever, because movies like these come once in a while. Every detail is so beautifully conceived that you wonder how the crew is motivated to deliver perfection in every scene without cutting a single corner. Hats off Hanu Raghavpudi.It's a pristine Telugu dialogue hence the intensity and impact on a native Telugu like me is perhaps much higher than the RoW viewers. So factor this in my exaggerated review here.Dulquer makes the movie an outright fantasia. You would want to be in it forever. I wondered earlier why Mrunal Thakur was cast, but not a doubt after watching her first minute. Perfect casting - everyone - backed by a scintillating score by Vishal Chandrasekhar.I am writing this review during the intermission. For me it's IMDb 11. Will be back soon in the movie theatre, to watch again and again, till it lasts.Intermission over, movie over, I drove back home in a state of stupor. Still haven't recovered. That's what a nice movie is all about - an immersive alternate reality that lasts very long. Listening to the soundtrack, because I don't want to get out of the milieu, I don't want to leave Dulquer ....Warning: Do not let my review raise the bar. Smell your beans before watching any movie.",10/10,Sita Ramam
pavan116,1 September 2022,Atlast an Army backdrop movie that quenches your thirst,"Finally after 2-3 misfires from Hanu Raghavpudi ( where Padi Padi Leche Manasu was my favourite) he proved his capability with Sita Ramam.Characters : The lead Pair is refreshing. DQ as Ram , Mrunal as Sita were mesmerizing.Rashmika and Tarun bascker added a good flavour to the movie.Music is at its best .No nee to tell about this , every movie of Hanu sir has this soothing and peacefull music.Vishal Chandrasheker did a good job.SP Charan sir voice nostalgically reminded of SPB garu.Coming to the Story point of view , the script is well built and the dialouges were too poetic.A dialoge in this movie goes as "" Kurukshetram lo Ravana Samharam , Yudhapu velugu lo Sita Swayamvaram "" Good one right ? , well there are many in this movie.The sets and the visuals are so brilliant and hats off to the director that he pulled off everything at 30cr.Highly recommended to watch .Itlu

animeshrose-59354,14 January 2023,Teary Eyed. Amazing work!,"I honestly was about to pass this movie because it belonged to romantic genre but looking at the ratings decided to give it a chance.The movie started slow and later picked up the plot and I kind of liked the overall plot and the suspense it builds the entire time,
However, few goofs are there like at the end, the character of Sita hasn't aged even a bit even after 20 years. Apart from that nothing I can really complain of!At the end movie rises to its climax and everything that was spreading around kind of knotted together in a beautiful way.Left me teary eyed at the very end.Mrunal and Salmaan has done a phenomenal job. Kudos to all the casts and the team involved.",9/10,Sita Ramam
gaganjiopostpaid,6 August 2022,Simply and emotional watch only,"It's good we'll made film , it's has average comedy , normal songs , bgm is excellent, absolutely family watch , film has to be watch free minded , then only you can connect to movie at some point , there are some controversial points in movie , but for me , emotion overlapped those points, so , mainly 1st half is slow , 2nd half is curious.

amritnayakduphy,1 October 2022,Heartfelt Masterpiece!!!!!,"Probably the last such classic I watched was ' Madrasapattinam '. The way the story in 'Sita Ramam' unfolds provide you with an emotional ride all the way. The perfect chemistry between Dalqueer and Mrunal is so soul-stirring. Both of them have done absolute justification to individual's characters.Hats off to the writer, director and the entire team for creating this masterpiece. The dialogues and the songs are cherry on top. The scenes depicting the romance between Ram and Sita will just melt your heart!!! It's a must watch for everyone.Another masterpiece added to my list that I will keep on recommending anyone asking me 'What's your favourite movie list?' :) :)

chand-suhas,7 August 2022,A beautiful poetry on screen.,"Hot headed Afreen (Rashmika Mandanna) reaches out to her grandfather to get out of trouble with a deadline of one month. There, she is tasked to fulfil her grandfather's last wish of delivering a letter written two decades ago by Lieutenant Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) to his lover Sita (Mrunal Thakur). Only if she delivers to Sita, Afreen will inherit her grandfather's property. This leads her on a path to Hyderabad, India in search of Sita without knowing who she is or who Ram is, unraveling their beautiful love story & also revealing why delivering this letter is Afreen's debt to Ram & Sita.The film is rich in visuals, kudos to cinematographer & even the art director to ensure such beautiful frames. The narrative pace is definitely slow & with a runtime of 160 odd minutes, it did feel lengthy. But it was the lead pair performance that held the film together till the end. It does take it's own sweet time in the first half to establish these two characters with non-linear narrative, but a strong interval point makes it all worth it.It is indeed the second half where the film truly works it's charm. It definitely had been a while since I watched a dedicated love story like this, where the director doesn't compromise or even deviate from his vision. The result being most cheesiest of lines actually working because the director along with the actors, succeeded in getting the audience invested in these characters, no matter how predictable the screenplay was.",7/10,Sita Ramam
akshatmahajan,21 November 2022,A beautiful love story but,"Sita Ramam is a beautiful love story about a army soldier and a princess. If we talk about the story, there was nothing new in the story and the plot was predictable. The only thing which was grasping the audience was the execution of the story (which I felt was loose), performances (which were good) and the music (some of them were good and some were like okay).The runtime was too long and pacing was also uneven. The climax felt little bit rushed. They could have executed that in a much better way.Overall, it was a good and sweet movie which you can enjoy with your family but don't expect anything exceptional.

niaz_islam,27 September 2022,Out Of Balance,"This was supposed to be a beautiful love story but turns out to be a pointless story rather having hardly any love in it.The script revolves haphazardly around one soldier and one princess. The story is so out of balance that it creates unnecessary situation to make a simple issue overly complicated and absurd emotional manipulation. The male protagonist saves female protagonist from danger for several minutes without even seeing her face which was simply insane. Moreover the acting of the supporting cast was excessively dramatized with subpar performance. Overall the film was quite unenjoyable.Not recommended.

vikramsamal,10 September 2022,Goosebumps,"Sita Ramam evokes multiple emotions in you. A True blue passionate romance that strikes numerous chords in your heart and leaves you speechless and choked. Loved every minute of it. Rarely a movie makes me want it to continue. This is that movie. The main leads have tremendous chemistry and you fall in love with both Sita and Ram. Brilliant cinematography and lovely scenes of Kashmir just makes it a memorable movie, one that will stay with me for a while. Be prepared for few tears as you pine for the lovers in their fight to stay together.. The direction is good and so is the music but what remains with you how effortless the two leads Dulquer and Mrinal have made us fall in love with Ram and Sita.

karpagkani,16 January 2023,Kudos,"Saluting the team to give such a wonderful patriotic movie that touches the heart with the awesome chemistry of the lead pair.Very very slow movie but had me glued to the seat with the lead pair cuteness, the search for Sita, background score, the final plot and not to forget the perfect locations.Those who had missed to see this movie but reading this review must watch it now. Even i went to the movie just for Dulqer, but i didn't expect such a performance by the entire team.. Even after coming back home, the memories of this movie has been haunting me all these days.Best movie of 2022.

phjftcrxvf,30 November 2022,Best romantic and emotional movie till date,"Best romantic movie of the decade. Class acting, script writing, emotions, music. Perfect direction, storyline and casting. Better than veer zara. Brilliant acting by dalquir and mrinual. Can't stop my tears rolling down . It took me a while to
Calm down my self from emotions. Very rare to have tears in this era of movies. True emotions will speak from acting and that is the beauty of this movie. Great locations and timing of the songs . This is the best movie of dalquir till date . I follow him afer karwan but that time didn't know his acting capabilites.Bollywood should learn from south cinema.

In this era of modern love it is a true picture of what love can be, kudos to the writer.It's a movie full of entertainment and. Acting direction screenplay and story 10/10 all. A movie that can stay in your heart when you live in real life.In last two months I have watched twice and each time same feelings even if I knew the story on second watch.No doubt it is one of the finest movie having a love story and it is hard to watch movies like this in this era.Though first half is little slow but second half contains lot of twists and turns making it thrilling and the ending is aweome.Thanks to the filmmaker, cast and crew.Note: It is a family friendly movie and even no kiss seen.",10/10,Sita Ramam

AdityaShankar0901,9 August 2022,Should've been either shorter or faster,"Rating:Story: 2.5/5
Production Values: 3.5/5
Screenplay: 1/5Review:Screenplay is very poor, narration is dull and head straining. The story is decent (not bad not good) and production values are good. Story doesn't go ahead.In short, this film would have been better if it was shorter/faster. Songs and comedy are silly and irritating. It is better to watch on OTT instead of theatres. You need a strong mind to bear 3 hours of the film!

vaidehiwadkar,23 December 2022,Masterpiece..!!,"I started feeling Romance as a genre is dead in movies, these days nobody is making it properly like they used to when we were growing up, it's not about the logic but that emotional depth those movies had and the magic they use to create is missing somewhere, the stories are no more engaging enough that will connect you on an emotional level, and then some people say that the times have changed, meaning of love and relationships have changed, no one is gonna watch an old school romance in a movie if made like they used to make it in 90s.And it's been a long time since I have watched a pure and most importantly an original story,
But I was surprised when I watched this film,
A beautiful and classic love story after a very long time, missing this kind of cinema all these years.The story, the performances, the dialogues, the frames, the music, everything is just so beautiful, it reminded me of my childhood days when I used to watch Yash Chopra's and SRK's movies (No comparison though !!)
In love with this film and specially in love with Ram, DQ was justtt soo good in this.Mrunal looks like a dream, the way hanu sir have presented Sita mahalakshmi on screen reminds me of how Mr. Yash Chopra use to present his leading ladies in his films.Literally each and every member of the cast have done an excellent job.Each frame looks like a painting, almost feels like watching a fairytale.It just made me fall in love with the concept of love all over again, that pure decent and simple old school love which i watched and belived in while growing up.Most importantly this movie is a proof that you don't always need to show intimate scenes to show love between two people, just the emotions are enough
Finally there is a movie which focuses on the core emotions.",10/10,Sita Ramam

Roman-pc,2 October 2022,Passable but still run-of-the-mill melodrama,"Been watching a LOT of Indian movies specifically Telugu language ones lately--many of them surprisingly good, but this one was only so-so. As melodramatic love stories go, this one stays pretty close to form. I like the premise--a soldier (Ram) receives letters from the mysterious Sita claiming to be his wife. But this one does very little different from expectation--there are echoes of The Notebook and pretty much every well-known love story including Roman Holiday. But while the latter remains a delicious vignette in a princess's life, Sita Ramam drags it out and overstays its welcome. Is it watchable? Sure. But ultimately forgettable.

best-review,5 August 2022,Overrated,"Good idea devoloped into a Weak Story, Imitative Narration.Age old screenplay with silly dialogues.Hanu's Direction is just an amateur imitation of 90's Maniratnam style.Dulkar is okay, Mrunal looks old and forced with the clumzy characterisation, rashmika may impress/irritate you with her cartoon face and overaction.Sumanth is misused like the rest of the useless characters- Prakash raj, Goutam menon, Priyadarshi etc..Production values are rich. All the losation and sets are very artificial and richCinematography and Background music are good, editing is not..Not worth even in OTT unless u never watched real classics like Bombay, Roja, Veer Zaara or Geetanjali.",5/10,Sita Ramam

But at the end you will feel something different that i can't explain.Music is really good & movie is quite fast paced if you think it will be slow as other love stories.If you don't like these one then i don't think you are movie lover.Please don't listen or believe in the negative reviews as they have been given without watching the movie. They just want to bring down the ratings of this movie.

Yesss , there is suspense too ! And it's like people who fallen in love are may be blind but
the people around him are not ! May be in real life too terrorist do that kind of conspiracy for creating discrimination and misunderstanding to civilians for Indian army ! What we can learn from this movie is never make your perception by just listening only cause sometimes it's just rumours that turned things into like inferno & second thing is make your love always pure with sharing everything between eachother . Third thing is your true love always support you no matter what and there is no doubts for eachother & last fourth is that never judge anyone just anyone *****

crravikiran,15 September 2022,Good attempt,"The movie is basically a drama with love genre . There have been many movies in the past with similar plots. But this one was executed to perfection which gives it a fresh feel. Although the movie moves at a slow pace it catches up after the interval . The Actors - Dulquer , Mrunal and Rashmika did a decent job. Personally I am not a fan of love genre movies and I prefer watching thriller movies but this one impressed me. The cinematographer did a great job as the movie was shot with great picturesque scenes. I watched it in Tamil and the dubbing seemed to match with the scenes. Overall I will give this 7/10 rating.

sujjjjet,4 December 2022,"In a word:- ""Masterpiece""","What a movie. Just brilliant. A beautiful love story, excellent direction, actors have done their job very well. Specially Dulkar Salman and Mrunal thakur. Music, Location, costume design etc everything was just perfect.From beginning it looks like a war movie but after 30 minutes suddenly story takes us to the main plot of the movie. You will be very keen to know about the character and what will happen next.Movies length is a little bigger but it is well directed and music is very beautiful. Dulkar Salman is gem of Indian cinema. Mrunal thakur looks very beautiful in the movie.If you love classic love story movies, then this movie is for you. Just go and watch this.This is the best love story movie Indian cinema has ever produced.",10/10,Sita Ramam

fahimaz786,13 October 2022,Too much hype,"Don't really know what make others love this movie so much or it's paid review. Movie is below average, it took me a week to finish the movie. Nothing interesting it's just too much hype. Nothing was special about this movie, slow, dragged a lot. I have nothing against actors or actresses it's just a dull movie, not a good story line. Few stupid scenes are there , Actress going to army camp whenever she feel like it, I wonder if they just let anybody in there without any valid cause. I have nothing against actors or actresses but there wasn't anything refreshing, same old stuff and running time is too long.

Golly I'm lost for words as I didn't expect the Hanu Raghavapudi directed DQ, Mrunal and Rashmika starrer Sita Ramam to be such a beautiful and poignant love story. It's better than Ok Kanmani and Charlie combined, take it from me üòÅ. I think what works for the film beyond the grand scale at which it's mounted is how lovable the central characters are. Their chemistry sizzles and they both sparkle on screen, so everything around them naturally becomes appealing. From the moment Rashmika, who plays an extended cameo, decides to take the plunge and help herself by helping Ram and Sita, we know Sita Ramam could become everything that Radhe Shyam promised. Each frame is like a therapy for sore eyes, such is the brilliant cinematography. Although the songs are just hummable, the BGM is truly soul stirring and there are so many epic moments in both halves that I probably need to watch this film again just to revel in them. Hanu had given a flop in his previous film Padi Padi Lechu Manasu, which although was good, was also a little overdone. So credit to DQ and Mrunal for trusting the maker in him and giving us such a poetic love story. There is also a very intelligently woven subplot featuring the fight against Pak supported Mujhahideen. The cowardice of the countries that decided to ban the film is truly astonishing though. About the lead pair: Mrunal is gorgeous and her costume designer deserves every accolade in the book. She slips into the role of Sita so easily that you really can't take your eyes off her. Dulquer brings his career best performance in the role of soldier Ram and his honest performance will leave many teary eyed. I thought he's going through an identity crisis of sorts but hell no, Sita Ramam is the best decision he's made till date. The fact that its Malayalam version was almost full in a theatre in London and that the film's growing organically among the buffs, show there's something there. Sita Ramam is not just another love story, it's an emotional, epic and eternal tale of unanswered and unfulfilled love that's sure to last the test of times and leave everyone watching, supremely satisfied.",10/10,Sita Ramam
hirenvaishnani,1 January 2023,Experienced The Love!!!,"I normally don't review a Movie as I think every person possess different views and choices. This is the first movie I am reviewing for some obvious reasons. Experiencing ""Love"" is neither outdated nor age restricted.Whenever We have to travel far, we start missing home and our loved ones. In other words, being not able to meet the loved ones is a pain. In unfavorable situations, such distance between us and our loved ones becomes more painful. Such pain makes us realise how much We love our home ,our family, our friends or someone special etc.. That Feeling Of ""Meeting Someone Die Heartedly"" is conveyed so nicely in this movie. Love Is Beyond Personal Meetings Is Also portrayed Nicely.I want to write so much, but I don't want to be a spoiler for all who haven't watched the Movie yet. All I want to write is, ""If You Know Love, You Will Experience It Again (and Again And Again...) And If You Don't, You Will Know It.. Through This Movie""All the Actors in The Movie Have Done A Great Job. A clean, heartwarming family entertainer.",10/10,Sita Ramam
rajvignesh-60140,24 September 2022,A heart and a true romantic movie,"One of the best romantic movies in recent times, one of the best, and dulquer , he is the chocolate boy of india, his charmness innocense and true to his character is really amazing , the way he shown this character is way too good. A so realistic romantic movie is recent past and the sita character who played also did her role way too perfect, its a quote everybody needs a love like sita mahalakshmi, and one of the important character done by rashmika, a guest appearance but an important one. The movie and screenplay is good but cud have been better, its usual and so predicting but overall a soo true romantic movie, For a moment i had a glimpse of Roja too which has a similar story but overall a good movie, pls do watch it available on prime video.

nimit-02609,8 January 2023,A Real Love Tale,"Sita Ramam is a bit of a tragic but 'true' love tale. Based on the classic 70's era, this movie shows you what real love means in these days of fake. It's a pure romance with a touch of humor in it and some unpredictable twists that surely satisfy you with the story. Both the leads have performed really very well. Dulquer has justified with the character of Ram, he just fits for the role and other crew have also played the respective roles very well.*Special mention for Mrunal Thakur, looking her feels like nobody would have fitted more well than her. Cute and innocent face of hers brings up more reality to the character.P. S - Gave a 9-star 'coz of Mrunal, she looked a par gorgeous in the Sita look. A woman that every man has dreamt of in his life.

neethaquarian,17 September 2022,Too much hype,"I watched the movie because of the hype but now I'm wondering what is the hype about. Story was okayish. It started good and then went down and again went up. The end did have me tearing. The place where Ram and Sita were living in Kashmir was more than what Ram could afford and since Sita hadn't revealed that she was Princess NoorJahan, it seemed illogical. The comedy was forced and many good actors were wasted.Dulquer Salman was his usual charming self. Mrunal Thakur looked good but didn't like her acting much. Both the leads had decent chemistry. Rashmika was decent.Overall wish the movie was shorter n since it is on OTT it is working, sitting in theater for so long would have been torturous.",6/10,Sita Ramam
Biswas_,24 November 2022,A remake that retains its own identity,"I have already seen the original 2021 Drishyam 2 hence while watching the Hindi remake, i knew what was coming. Still i watched it to see what changes the Hindi version makes to the original or is it just a blatant copy paste.The answer is NO! It is not a blatant copy paste. Let me tell you in points about them:-1. Having not seen the original Drishyam 1 but the Hindi drishyam 1, i didn't knew that Gaitonde's character is a unique addition to the Hindi version. This , even in Drishyam 2 is a masterstroke.2. Gaitonde lives up to that hateful character he had from the 1st film. The Hindi version has slightly altered the police station interrogation scene in the 2nd half and this is where the Hindi version outclasses the Malayalam version and the difference was Gaitonde.3. Akshay Khanna as the IG is another masterstroke addition who fills in the shoes of IGP Thomas . While Thomas was direct and strict, Akshay Khanna is sarcastic in his tone and has this evil way of talking that gives him his own identity. Another place where the Hindi version scores full marks. He's done a terrific job.4. Another thing that gives the Hindi version it's own popularity is the famous ""Satsang"" confession. When again brought up here, the crowd roared ! Shows you how this Satsang thing has had its own fan following as compared to the confession in the Malayalam version.5. The fact that certain scenes have been a little altered to avoid being called a blatant copy paste, for example the film begins with a person murdering another and then running in the jungles. The Malayalam version started straight from the running part without much showing the sequence why he was running.6. The elder daughter's illness was better captured in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one just seems to add it for name sake.7. The final climax courtroom scene was , imo, better executed in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one felt like it was rushing to the main points of the climax. Also that scene in the court where Vijay and the IG cross each other , this too was a little better in the Malayalam version where George kutty and Thomas crossed each other and that expression on Thomas's face was better.8. Tabu and even Rajat Kapoor have nothing much to do as the spotlight are taken by Vijay, Akshaye and Gaitonde.Overall, Drishyam 2 hindi is a very good remake of the original, just like Drishyam 1 was despite change in directors. It almost felt like Abhishek Pathak had the soul of Nishikant Kamat in him while making this film. At this point, we all can agree that the Hindi version has made an identity of its own , thanks to including new characters and property modifying certain scenes. A tight slap on the face of those who thought this was to be an ott film.",9/10,Drishyam 2
ketgup83,18 November 2022,Faithful remake,"************ Movie Review *****Ajay Devgn's Drishyam, released in 2015, was simply superb which was an official remake of Malayalam film Drishyam starring Mohanlal thanks to its thundering climax and electrifying screenplay.The sequel, Drishyam 2, which releases today takes the story forward when the IG (played by Akshaye Khanna ) re-opens the case which led to the disappearance of son of Meera (Tabu), leading the trail back to Vijay Salgaonkar and his family.While the first film was directed by late Nishikant Kamat, Abhishek Pathak returns to the director's chair with slow-burn and yet engaging story written brilliantly by Jeetu Joseph with twist and turns enough to keep you at bay. Drishyam 2 starts off on a slow note but gathers the steam towards the second half. The series of events infuses life to the film and will keep you guessing with what-will-happen-next scenes. Of course, the editing could have better reducing the duration of the film, especially in the first half.It is the last one hour of the film which makes it an interesting watch thanks to the outstanding climax. The only actor who could match to the calibre of Mohanlal is Ajay Devgn . The actor expresses adequately through his eyes and gives a stunning performance. Akshaye Khanna is just turning out to be fabulous with each and every role he plays and this one is definitely on the radar. Tabu and Shriya Saran's character could have been better written.So, overall, Drishyam2 is worthy sequel to 2015 s Drishyam which should be applauded for its skillful writing, brilliant performances and astounding climax.-Ketan Gupta.",8/10,Drishyam 2

sanjubhat,22 November 2022,Absolutely unmissable!! Ajay Tabu and Akshaye Khanna rock!!,"Film review - Drishyam 2
#sanjuzzreviews #Drishyam2 #AjayDevgan #tabu #AkshayeKhannaSuperb, fantastic, fantabulous, inconceivable are some of the adjectives that will come to people's minds after watching this film. Even after watching the Mohanlal's 2021 Malayalam original, I enjoyed this Hindi remake immensely !!The story takes off 7 years after the incidents depicted the first installment happen, with Vijay Salgaonkar ( Ajay Devgan) and his family trying to move on with their lives. However the fear of the law catching up with them affects each one of them differently. The police, having lost round 1 haven't given up hope and are trying every trick in the book to nab Vijay !!Who wins this cat & mouse game forms the crux of the plot.The Hindi remake, like the original has a runtime of 2 hrs 33 mins & around 1 hr 30 mins are pretty laid back with the story proceeding at a leisurely pace. But dont get fooled by this as the movie picks up speed in the last one hour as it moves ahead with one dhamaka after another culminating in a mind-blowing climax.Performances by Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna are exceptionally good. Tabu, Shriya Saran , Rajat Kapoor, Kamlesh Sawant and Ishita Dutta too are awesome!!An absolutely unmissable movie that remains faithful to the original. It was heartening to see audiences cheer Akshaye & Ajay's dialogues just like the good old times. Go watch it in the theatres .. you won't be disappointed for sure!!Going with 4 stars out of 5 ..

Ajay Devgan and Tabu did great and everyone else enabled them to excel in it.The cinematography was amazing keeping you hooked onto your seats.The best part was the casting was the same as part 1.

Prashast_Singh,24 December 2022,One of the best the year's finest thrillers.,"I might not have been able to experience the magic of Drishyam, one of the best crime thrillers from Bollywood even though a remake, on the big screen, but I was determined to experience the sequel in cinemas at any cost. Also, this was my first experience of a night show, and that too without wearing any masks as opposed to my previous cinema visits. And man, I was wowed. Drishyam 2 delivered nonstop entertainment and lived up to the expectations.Unlike the first film where I didn't know what to expect from the plot, I knew about this one and hence expected twists from the beginning, due to which the first half felt slower. The previous one had a lot of twists in the first half alone, due to which comparisons are inevitable. But the first half isn't wasted in unnecessary songs or comedy. It cleverly prepares the conflict through introductions of characters both old and new, and like a proper slow-burning crime drama, gives ample time to the development of the plot. You might feel that the intermission block has arrived either too early or nothing too big has happened this far, but trust me, you're in for a surprise! What might feel unimportant in the beginning will turn out to be a major asset in hindsight!As the second half begins, the tension begins to rise. Casting Akshaye Khanna as the rival of Vijay (played flawlessly by Ajay Devgn) turns out to be a brilliant choice, as he proves to be menacing at times even though we know he is not a bad guy. There are references made to the previous film, which can both surprise and make you chuckle. Unlike big-budget blockbusters we've seen this year, Drishyam 2 isn't replete with otherworldly visual effects or songs to make you tap your foot.Then what is it that captivates you and makes you ignore the lack of the aforementioned elements? The story. Yes, you might buy the ticket for the stars as they're all big names, but you'll leave your seat impressed more with the story. I can't imagine the film without the intelligently written story which compensates for the lack of any masala or visual spectacle one might be mistaking this film to offer. Also, I would love to reiterate that the performances were all terrific, and provided just the right amount of support to the story and the overall product. The final act is the best part of the film where I couldn't believe what happened and also couldn't help but laud the genius writing.Even though a remake (I will check out the original and other remakes too), Drishyam 2 is one of the finest thrillers of the year and promises entertainment replete with drama, suspense and surprises worth the price of your ticket. It's good to see the film is running successfully even though there are new releases out in cinemas. I'm glad I didn't wait for the OTT release and instead went ahead with enjoying this masterpiece on the big screen. Recommended!",10/10,Drishyam 2

milindsharma-53018,23 November 2022,This Hindi remake destroyed the most important scene in the original Malayalam Drishyam 2 and rushes the best parts of the climax in the original.,"After watching the trailer of the hindi remake of Drishyam 2, I was excited to watch it even though I knew the twist after watching the original one starring Mohanlal.So finally went and watched it today, found the first half more interesting than the original and got hyped as the best part was yet to come.And then when the climax portions start, they go destroy the best part of the original movie which is the scene where the biggest twist is revealed.This is the scene where the judge reads the DNA report in the courtroom and reveals that the skeleton is not of Sameer.Now let me tell you what the difference is in both versions and how this remake ruined it:Malayalam Version - In the courtroom everyone is shell shocked, cut to police/Tabu gang - Tabu character stands up and yells 'Noooo'. Closeup of everyone in shock, great bgm and such an impactful scene. Top cop Murali Gopy in frustration says ""What was the damn climax?""Hindi Version - Zero reaction from Tabu/Akshaye and gang! Seriously? What were you thinking? Such a big twist and everyone is just looking down as if they knew it all along and Akshaye just mumbles ""Woh doosra climax kya tha?"". As if twist gaya baad mein mujhe toh kahani sun ne ka hain! Even in court room just confused looks, not shock. And Ajay Devgn just stares in one direction. Look at Mohanlal, still in character looking down with shame for what has happened.Akhaye Khanna did a splendid job but they changed the role of the top cop in the original a lot which I didn't like. In the original it felt natural and more like an IG/police officer played brilliantly by Murali Gopy whereas Akshaye's role felt more like that of an income tax officer rather than a cop.Shriya Saran is a huge letdown because she can't act and just keeps moving her eyeballs in various directions to express fear or takes a big gasp and it looks so weird.The torture scene by Gaitonde was not required and I actually laughed out during that scene because Shriya Saran taps the table she is thrown on, which looks like as if she is in a WWE submission match.In the original it was more of a mental torture which looked more natural.So they improved few things from the original but destroyed the best scene and rushed the climax, made some bad changes as mentioned above.You may enjoy it if you haven't watched the original. But later if you watch the original one, you'll know what I'm talking about.",6/10,Drishyam 2
cs_rahul_kumar,18 November 2022,A Very Gripping and Intelligent Sequel With Perfect Twits and Turns !!!,"The sequel to Drishyam, which is adapted from a Malayalam thriller of the same name, begins where the 2015 film had left off-Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) emerging from a police station carrying a shovel. Seven years ago, the almost-perfect crime had a witness, and that's what gives the police impetus and ammo to revisit the Sameer Deshmukh missing-case investigation so many years later.Vijay is now a theatre owner who dreams of making a film based on a story he has written. His elder daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) is still reeling from the shock of the traumatic events, while his younger daughter Anu (Mrunal Jadhav) is in her teens. Every member of the family, including his wife Nandini (Shriya Saran), is moving on with life as usual-but always on guard. And with a haunting sense of fear which never leaves them. A series of unexpected events turn the Salgaonkars' lives upside down when a truth threatens to change everything.Even the support Vijay received from his community seven years ago, begins to dwindle as the plot unfolds, and they begin to question if he actually committed the crime. The film gathers up steam when the police investigation led by Inspector General of Police Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna), and Sameer's (who's accidental death in Drishyam formed of the crux of both the films) mother and former IG Meera (Tabu), swings into action. This time, they follow the leads without underestimating the protagonist.Following a similar pattern like the first, helmed by the late Nishkant Kamat, here director Abhishek Pathak takes things slowly in the first half. The family's dread and anxiety are palpable as he gradually builds the tension in the narrative. As the investigation progresses, every character serves a distinct purpose, and helps heighten the drama and suspense.Ajay Devgn shines as a protective father who loves his family unconditionally; he is a simple man with a razor-sharp mind. Akshaye Khanna, who in the past has played a cop, in films like Mom and Ittefaq, lends much gravitas to these gripping proceedings. Tabu is simply outstanding as Meera, a mother seeking justice for her son. Rajat Kapoor shines as her husband who eagerly wants everything to be settled soon. Kamlesh Sawant reprises his role as Gaitonde, who is still ruthless and bloodthirsty for revenge. Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, and Mrunal Jadhav, who play other Salgaonkars, have almost similar roles as they had in the previous part. Saurabh Shukla as writer Murad Ali plays his part well to resolve the mystery.Jeethu Joseph's original story is skilfully adapted by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak. They deftly weave in multiple threads, leading to a stellar climax packed with numerous twists that are as good as the first film. While the first one undoubtedly had a certain novelty to it, the sequel stands strong too, it intrigues and entertains. The story here remains unpredictable for the most part, however, some of the setups seem contrived and some situations too far-fetched. Having said that, making a sequel to a very successful first part wherein most of the characters are the same is quite a challenge.Amitabh Bhattacharya's song Sahi Galat that comes with the credits and the title track is upbeat. Saath Hum Rahein is slow but perfectly filmed to capture the bond family share. The background score by Rockstar DSP (Devi Sri Prasad) blends well and adds to the intensity of the drama.Overall, Drishyam 2 dishes out plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked throughout, just like its predecessor. And the story of the Salgaokars will continue to remain in public memory.",10/10,Drishyam 2
usernamesoumya,20 November 2022,One of the biggest plottwists for any world class level cinema,"Just came back from the theatre, I have no words to describe my inner excitement, and that ""Uffffff"" moment.... I would suggest, weak hearted people should avoid watching this movie. The plottwist was unexpected, and even after watching, you wouldn't believe. Screenplay, Direction, background music, heavy weight story, and acting everything was magnificent. I was at the edge of my seat, and the movie engaged me fully in the 2nd half. Though first half was a bit slow, but when the thrill started going high, chill went through my veins....... Undoubtedly, it was a world class level plot twist in the climax... ...

sarthakbharad-36851,7 December 2022,"there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.","Stepping into the theatre, it is natural for you to think, is there really the need of a sequel? Is it just gonna be another cash grab or there really is more story to tell which can match the complex narrative and high stakes of the first film which was so perfect in every way? Believe me, in the climax, you'll literally start clapping to the film's genius.The film starts off with the anticipation that Vijay and his family from the first film might, they just might get caught for their crime they committed 7 years ago and managed to get away with it by fooling the entire police department just on the basis of visual deception.The film starts off slow prioritizing the world-building and characters over the plot, but that's just the beginning, because the payoff it gives at the end (trust me, it's even more bonkers now) is just phenomenal. Having written a script myself (which took me 3 weeks by the way), I can only imagine of getting such wild and risky ideas to put in the climax. Cheers to the original writer Jeethu Jospeh for coming up with such unique concepts and connecting them to cinema.Ajay devgn once again beautifully portrays the protagonist (still scecptical on this one) Vijay Salgaonkar who appears stoic and calm on the outside but is planning everything to keep the secret ""buried"" on the inside. Tabu as this ex-cop turned grieving mother out for revenge and closure is just a perfect follow-up to the original film. Kamlesh savant returns in his role as Gaitonde and does not disappoint, he still oozes the same anger he had 7 years ago on Vijay for ruining his career because he was the only one who knew the truth behind it all but lacked the evidence to prove it. But, out of all the returning cast members, it was Akshaye Khanna, the new addition to this universe, that stole the show. Just his presence is enough to make the screen shine and his dialogue delivery is enough to give you the chills.The soundtrack once again, hits hard. Absolutely thrilling and apt for the scenes. Alhough, it isn't Vishal Bhardwaj who has composed it, Anil Johnson does manage to keep up with him and provide some good scores.One thing I would like to point out is that the film also delves deeper into Vijay's mindset as a person. It perfectly depicts how Vijay and his family with him will have to be in fear their entire lives just to keep the crime they committed a secret. Even though, they are free, freedom isn't with them. There is a beautiful line at the end of the film which goes like, ""even if Vijay manages to escape the cops with his wits forever, he will never be able to match eyes with the parents of Sameer Deshmukh (the boy who was murdered in the first film)"" indicating how ashamed he is and his life itself is his punishment.A perfect sequel, that's it. Vijay Salgaonkar is indeed, the smartest man alive.P. S.: this film does a few things different than the original Mohanlal film in order to streamline the runtime and it does manage to do so successfully, but deep down, I feel that it was Georgekutty's (Mohanlal) journey that comes a step above (you'll understand it if you watch the original Malayalam film) and shines just a little brighter than this.",10/10,Drishyam 2
Fella_shibby,29 November 2022,Gasp-inducing twists n turns throughout with a solid unsettling atmosphere.,"I saw this on the third day of its theatrical release with my entire family n extended family.Once again like it's predecessor, this one too aint ur regular Bollywood trash as there aint no songs, no dance, no unnecessary shirtless stuff, no gravity defying badly choreographed action, no jingoism n no melodrama.The cinematography is top notch n so are the performances.Akshay Khanna looks like he is heavily suffering from muscle wasting. He is a good actor but he needs to take care of his muscle mass n bone density.This one is better than Suspect X (2008), Perfect Number (2012) n The Devotion of Suspect X (2017).All are based on the 2005 novel The Devotion of Suspect X (2005) by Keigo Higashino.",9/10,Drishyam 2

manitverma,20 November 2022,Wonderful Story,"Ajay Devgan delivers his first hit after debacles like Thank God and Runway 34. Nice selection of script he has probably done. Tabu as always gives a powerful and impactful performance after Bhool Bhulaiya 2. Like Part 1 the role she had done in part 2 it's awesome and better than part 1. Having a talented actor like Akshaye Khanna is what makes the film pull off in theatre's. Rajat Kapoor makes a brilliant comeback and performance again in Drishyam 2 unlike in part 1 he did. Saurabh Shukla delivers a good performance though his role could have been a little more. Overall full paisa vasool film go watch in theatres near you.

Ajay Devgan's Acting is superb Akshay khanna, Tabu, Shreya Saran, Ishita Dutta all doing good job. Story is good backgroud sound is superb. Climax is big plus point of this movie. Some other actors who played diffrent roles also doing good job. 1st half can be 5 to 10 minutes short. Some light comedy moments is also very good i think this comedy moments good for this type serious movies. So if you like 1st part of movie you will be like second part also. In my opinion a must watch movie for all cinema lovers.",9/10,Drishyam 2

Justifiable Remake üëç""Some mystery remain to be unsolved which toils the peace of the victim"" & here Vijay Salgaonkar and family undergoes the same pain even after 7 years. Whether this time Vijay will be behind the bars??? Needs to be watched.Those who had watched the sequel of Drishyam 2 , malayalam version will definitely know the climax but those who don't, Ajay Devgn's Drishyam 2 will be an intriguing thriller movie experience.Those who have watched the original also might feel the thrill as here we could able to see how Vijay Salgaonkar, his family , the police handles this case..When talking about the performance, it was a pool of talents on one screen. Akshay Khanna cop presence was totally a different experience of what Murali Gopy had performed.Akshay Khanna's portraying as IG wherein he portrays as a cop with shrewdness, composed mind but knows where to hit. His screen presence was totally an add on flavour to the movie.Gaitonde inclusion in the script which is an addition from the original also brought a laughter and suspense kinda ambience.Apart from that, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran, Tabu, Rajat Kapoor again worn up their respective dresses of their characters and gave a stellar performanceSo, after a long time a well known remake movie but still refreshed to watch as this crime which is still refreshed after many years.",9/10,Drishyam 2
anmolagarwal-37547,20 November 2022,The story writing just blows your mind!,"Usually when sequels fail in Indian cinema, drishyam 2 has held its ground very firmly and the writers have done a phenomenal job! The story, the build-up is superb. It's a must must watch. Loved it!The movie doesn't loose it's pace even once. The story before or after the intermission just kept us at the edge of our seats! I didn't even left my seat for a 2nd round of popcorn! Imagine! I wish to see this movie again.The cast is as usual amazing and the director has kept the time of the movie very much on point. No glamour. Just the story. That's what we expect the cinema to be. Great job to every contributing member of the crew and cast.

critiquerimdb,20 November 2022,Not airtight but worth watching,"Sequel to the much raved about Drishyam, Drishyam 2 redefines what it means to make a sequel. Bare minimum, yes, but in this age of constantly degrading depth and meaning in Bollywood, where sequels are nothing but a way to capitalise on the brand of a successful film, this is a heartening sight. That doesn't absolve Drishyam 2 of its flaws, though.The pacing in the first half is understandably slow, given its genre, but at times it leaves you restless. The film does reward you for most of it in the second half - specially the climax - but I believe the first half could still have done with a bit more judicious editing.There's also issues with direction. For instance, the film is naggingly obsessed with the slow-motion effect to the point that it overuses it and it inevitably loses impact even in scenes where it should have worked.The film's cast is fantastic. Be it the lead cast of Ajay Devgn to Akshaye Khanna or the supporting cast of Kamlesh Sawant (Gaitonde) to Siddharth Bodke (Braganza). The background music adds perfectly to the film and the cinematography captures the magic of Goa (and its relentless rains) beautifully. The film also hits the buildup right and has definitely set up the third part well with the revelations in the climax. However, a key part of the denouement relies on suspension-of-disbelief which for a realistic thriller like Drishyam 2 is bothersome. Without getting into the spoilers, I would just say this film isn't as airtight as the first part was. It's also not as engaging as the first part which got to the point much faster.Overall, Drishyam 2 is still worth watching for it is a rare thriller franchise that is both indigenously made and entertaining for the most part. I am going with 6/10. Bonus points for being the first film to use humor against the brainless and jobless boycottbollywood propagandists.",6/10,Drishyam 2

tutoriallteperlpython,19 November 2022,Absolutely brilliant film.,"Absolutely brilliant film. Wonderful acting by all characters - but main role Ajay Devgan!! What a turnaround in plot after second half!!Although most of people know the story after watching malyalam version of drishyam 1 and 2, but the acting by akshaye Khanna, Tabu, Ajay Devgan's Family and Ajay Himself steals the show.About the film-
1st part is little bit boring as they spend 1 hour in introduction of characters and their family life!! David who saw Vijay disposing the body could have told the police about him much earlier which can make the film end little bit earlier but since film is about maintaining suspense till last, it fits better.I would recommend everyone to watch this movie in theatres and not on ott.",10/10,Drishyam 2
eldreddsouza,3 January 2023,Just ok...,"Keeping it short, I just didn't enjoy this movie as much as I hoped i would. I've watched the Malayalam Dhrishyam 2 several times. Despite knowing the suspense that too. It's because the film apart from its strong story was also technically brilliant. Also the chemistry between its cast members was impeccable. That family looked like a legit family and Mohanlal and his wife looked like a traditional Indian couple. Absolutely flawless chemistry. Same thing unfortunately can't be said about this Hindi remake. There was zero chemistry here. Also the kids were forgettable unlike the original where you will clearly remember the kids in the family.I'm not against remakes as long as they are done perfectly. But this is, forget perfect, not even just good enough. I liked The Hindi part 1 and his absence in this part can be clearly felt here. This director doesn't hold a candle to Nishikant Kamat who made a remake also equally good as the brilliant original.I guess it's all due to comparison. My younger cousin seemed to like this and she hadn't watched the original. So maybe if you haven't watched the original Malayalam movie then you will like this but as someone who holds the original to his heart, this remake was absolutely disappointing. Very forgettable.",6/10,Drishyam 2
TreeFiddy53,3 January 2023,Good remake!,"A lot has been spoken about this and the original so I'll do a minor comparison of both.The remake probably also began filming after lockdown, so that would have helped.Malayalam - slow burn, more of a drama until the end. Hindi - made for a commercial audience, shorter runtime and more 'cinematic' shots and dialogues.The build up of daughter's trauma, the friendship between Jenny and Shriya seemed rushed only on comparison - but you don't feel it when you're watching Hindi just by itselfThe IG 'reveal' seemed more 'dramatic' in the Hindi version.The sets in Hindi were TOO CLEAN. Why is Vijay Salgaonkar living in a palace? Georgekutty's place wasn't too big, was it?I thought Mohanlal and Meena looked more 'regular' than Ajay and Shriya, she looked like she was in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. Adds to the plot? No. Takes away from the plot, no. So, not sure why.Overall - still a brilliant story regardless of if you've watched the original or not.",8/10,Drishyam 2
puranjanbasak,3 January 2023,Drishyam 2,"Drishyam 2 is a crime drama mystery thriller film directed by abhishek pathak. It is the official remake of the malayalam film 'drishyam 2' directed by jeethu joseph.Well, what do i say about ajay devgn. He is the living embodiment of 'be so expressive with your eyes, that your words don't hv much to do.' Again, he has acted full to his potential. His body language, dialogue delivery everything is on point. Shriya saran gave a decent performance according to me. Ishita dutta and mrunal jadhav brought the required aftereffects of trauma and distress. Akshaye khanna really elevated the scenes with his determined demeanor. He brought a sense of stoic presence in the film, a worthy opponent of vijay. Tabu and rajat kapoor did not have much space to do anything. The rest of the cast did their job. Kamlesh sawant as gaitonde again brings in that kick with his evil shades.Technically, this film is superior to any that you would find. Its cinematography uses a cold hue to saturate its frames, maybe as a picture to what trauma and PTSD feels like. The shottaking is good as well. The sound design and background score is enthralling and epic. In the scenes of high intensity and tension, the bgm elevates the film to a whole new level. Superb work!!The screenplay is tight and engaging. The first half builds up the characters, which honestly,
i would have liked more. The second half brings in the mystery and tension which we are accustomed to with a drishyam film. The twists and turns are logical and have been justified as well. They really do surprise you. The two very superficial characters at the beginning are dealt with superbly in the climax. This also indicates how much realism and logic has went into the writing. Really loved it!!The dialogues are gold. And when you have stalwarts like ajay, tabu and akshaye with their gold dialogue delivery, its such a sweet pie. Dialogues have always been the strong suit of a drishyam film.I would have loved to see how late nishikant kamat would have handled it. RIP sir!! Nevertheless, this has been a bomb film with an excellent execution and superb twists and turns. Must watch!! 9.5/10.",10/10,Drishyam 2
ksiraj-61833,18 November 2022,This movie is good for one time watch but not the same as mohanlal's drishyam watch it if you like the trailer just go to the nearest cinema,"I watched this movie on the first day of the first show but I was really disappointed by the storyline starting 1 hour of movie they only showing on positive scene no mystery no investigation of tabu son's murder no action no thriller only family drama actually they've wasted one hour of audience it was too boring it's worth it when akshay khanna comes to screen he reopened the case and mystery was begun only last 30 minutes are mind blowing
And they show real cruelty and film climax is also really good, come to the direction whole movie is frame to frame shoot just same as mohanlal's drishyam This movie director should learn direction how to direct and shoot the scenes, most of the scenes he spoiled over all movie is really good ajay devgan acting is good no doubt about it tabu and akshay played really awesome performance they fitted in the character,and background score is not that good but bollywood should stop making remakes cuz people are already fed up ,They didn't watch anymore people are already boycotting they must start with a new format Otherwise bollywood will disappear only seen in web series it's a average sequel .

jay-techie2007,14 December 2022,Great watch!,"Drishyam 1 had set the high expectations from this one and it doesn't disappoint for the most part.The storyline is great. The way they've brought the turns and twists keep you hooked. Some things do looked a bit stretched, in terms of imagination, but still a good plot and execution.The cast is pretty much the same, except the addition of Akshay Khanna. Very similar, amazing, performances from the repeat cast. They could have gone with someone better than Akshay Khanna, like Boman Irani or Raj Kumar Rao. AK struggles with expressions and doesn't seem to be contributing to lift the movie.Overall, it is still a good watch, especially if you have been a Drishyam fan.

abhilashaa,5 December 2022,Flawless copied work,"Right from the opening scene, each frame was well connected to the first version. The detailing for each scene was simply mind-blowing to watch. Most of the characters played in the first version were retained and only few new faces played their part in the sequel. All the new characters introduced in the sequel were perfectly synced with the plot. Director justified the new roles and their contribution for the twist and turns in the screenplay is quite amazing. Moreover, that build up is needed to create that tension atmosphere in the minds of the audience. In terms of making and screenplay the first version is too good but it is a worthy best try from the director to give us a edge of a seat thriller experience in the sequel.Overall, Drishyam 2 is a rare best made sequel.

SAMTHEBESTEST,19 November 2022,An honest copy-paste makes for a thrilling watch to the freshers.,"Drishyam 2 (2022) :
Movie Review -Ajay Devgn, aka Vijay Salgaonkar, is back to save his family and fool the cops again. As he quotes, ""Sach ek din bahar aa hi jata hai,"" we were all prepared for the body to be found even before watching the film. Mohanlal's ""Drishyam"" (2013) was a sensation in Malayalam cinema and in the movie buffs' universe because nobody would have expected a cover-up thriller to be so good and captivating. Nobody would have imagined a sequel to the masterpiece suspense Drishyam had, but then we had Jeethu Joseph and Mohanal's duo pulling off an impossible and unimaginable classic sequel to cult Drishyam. The Hindi remake, ""Drishyam"" (2015), couldn't become a sensation and a huge blockbuster at the box office like the original Malayalam flick, but it gained a great fan following in the past 6-7 years. Now, the sequel is finally here, and it's another honest remake like the first one.Drishyam 2 takes place seven years after Sameer Deshmukh's murder mystery, as Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) and his family members are still looking for peace and happiness. Meanwhile, a newly appointed IG, Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna), has started to investigate the same case to prove Vijay's crime. Suspended inspector Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant) and Mira Deshmukh (Tabu) try their best to find proof against Vijay to avenge the humiliation and personal loss. At last, the body is found, a few pieces of evidence are collected, and Vijay confesses to his crime. But will that be the end or has the fourth-failed Vijay Salgaonkar got some bigger plans to fool the cops? Go to the nearest movie theatres to know all the answers.Drishyam 2 was an easy script for the makers, as they simply copied and pasted the original source material. I don't know what changes Abhishek Pathak has made, as he claimed in media interviews, except for Gaitonde's addition to the narrative. The Malayalam flick is about the protagonist vs. The new IG, whereas the Hindi remake is about the protagonist vs. 3 cops (Tarun, Gaitonde, and Mira). This seems to have done injustice to Akshaye Khanna's character because the Malayalam flick gave full exploration to that character. The runtime is slightly less, but it didn't feel that engaging at all. Drishyam 2 does have a couple of scenes of its own, though, but nothing more impressive or better than the Malayalam thriller.Ajay Devgn's Vijay Salgaonkar is quite different from Part 1, and rightfully so. The gap of 7 years has to be filled with a few changes in appearances, and Ajay wore all the changes very well. Those intense eyes are at work again. Shriya Saran gives a top-notch performance, and Tabu is amazing in whatever few scenes she has. Ishita Dutta has grown up as a character, but it reflects on her performance too. I was expecting more from Akshaye Khanna, but he was slightly underwhelming. Mrunal Jadhav, Prathamesh Parab, and Saurabh Shukla barely appear to be noticed, whereas Kamlesh Sawant's Gaitonde still leaves the same impact. Overall, the acting unit has done fairly well, but the potential was greater because this was a performance-oriented film.We always say that an ideal suspense thriller shouldn't have songs and a runtime of over 100 to 110 minutes. Hollywood understood it in the 30s only, when they started making talkie cinema, but the techniques, storytelling, and viewing consumption have indeed evolved over the years. Drishyam 2 is neither songless nor less than 2 hours long, yet it doesn't feel boring. Don't know how, but the film has actually managed to do it. Malayalam Drishyam 2 did look longer, but it was a proper cinematic experience, which forced the viewers to overlook the length. The Hindi remake tries to work on the issue but doesn't add up to anything effective. The technical aspects are nice, be it cinematography, editing, or the background score.Abhishek Pathak is promising in his second film, but I think he has a lot to learn, especially in the cinematic sense of storytelling. You remember the courtroom scene in the Malayalam flick when the judge says it and the camera goes zooming in on George Kutty with slow motion visuals and a staggering background score? That was a damn classy frame. Believe it or not, but Abhishek Pathak has missed it here. Yes, you heard it right-he missed the best moments from the classic thriller while remaking it in Hindi. Jeethu kept it intact even in Venkatesh's Telugu remake, but Pathak just couldn't understand what it actually meant. He missed many important pauses, too. As you know, copy-pasting a story or film is easy, but copying somebody's vision is not possible. Drishyam 2 Hindi remake might prove it to you. Except for a few faults like this, there is nothing majorly wrong with the Drishyam 2. And like he says, hero to aakhir me jeetna chahiye! We all enjoy that.RATING - 6/10*",6/10,Drishyam 2
movie_goer82,6 January 2023,Awesome Sequel,"Perfect sequel to the one of the best Thriller of the Indian cinema.I had watched the Malayalam version so I knew the story. Hindi version is frame by frame copy of the original malayalam version.All the cast did justice to their roles. Direction is top notch same as the first one.But, Real hero of such movies are the script writers like Jeethu Joseph who came up with brilliant scripts and the director Abhishek Pathak who did the justice with script. The outcome is another masterclass after Drishyam.9 out of 10 stars because I have watched the original Malayalam version(10/10) and I feel that Mohanlal was better than Ajay Devgan.

rostat-37224,31 December 2022,BLOCKBUSTER !!,"What you will do if you want to protect your family from a murder case ?! . Drishyam, it's a movie about small happy family but there life turned upside down because of a murder case . Before you watch the second part of the movie I advice you to watch the first part for the sequence of events . And honestly the movie needs Focus and attention .First of all , I would like to say that this movie is the best Criminal movie I have ever seen before . Its really the best and its a completed movie from all sides . The cast is amazing and the acting is so good , the way ajay devgan and tabu and that new police officer also the family members of ajay's they all acted amazing , but the most two people who acted really amazing are ajay and the new police officer and the daughter of ajay .The second thing is the plot . So many twists and so many things that makes your mind blow and burn , you can't expect it . You expect everything but not the plot especially the ending . The third thing I liked is the soundtrack and the music and the quality of the movie , it was amazing and suits the weather of the movie and really amazing . The last thing I liked and the most is the directing and how they showed the plot I mean the way they did is Fantastic and so creative .To sum up , I want to say this is the first movie since 2019 I didn't write the disadvantages and things that I didn't like because I really mean it that this movie a perfect completed movie and I liked evrything about it . Also I advice you to watch if you were free or bored and I advice you to put it on your Movies list don't miss it . Finally I would like to say that I rate this movie 10 out of 10 . Better to watch it !!",10/10,Drishyam 2
ashokkk-02581,18 December 2022,Simply mindblowing,"Watched a bollywood movie after a long time and it definitely didn't dissappoint. Sequels in bollywood are always not much correlated but this one is just out of this world. Keeps you at the edge of your seat from strat to begining. Ajay devgan's acting is just brilliant. He never dissappoints. The other characters have also done their job very well. The direction is well knitted and you don't find a moment where you actually want to keep your eyes away from the movie. Most of the time when it comes to a sequel of a thriller movie, you don't really get connected and are made only for the sake of money. But this one has to be one of the best, of not the best.

suvadeep-39495,18 November 2022,A Masterpiece indeed!,"An excellent storyline with intense suspense after interval... The story gets it's true nature with the powerpact acting of Ajay Devgan and Akshay Khanna... The climax its just mind-blowing and no one can ever guess before the way story unfolds its secret... From the starting of the movie the background music helps you to sense the true suspense... The malaylam movie was diamond but is certainly a diamond with much more cuts and luster in it... Akshay khanna gives his powerful presence in almost every frame... The series is truly very very special for all the thriller lovers... Go and watch this must watch movie with no nonsense flawless story...

AnoopVarma,5 December 2022,Drishyam 2 an excellent sequel,"A great execution of a brilliant suspense thriller story in decent backdrop of Goa by Abhisek Pathak and his Team. Cinematography by Sudhir Chaudhary & Sandip Francis's Editing is something classic. The Film drives by thrill factor. Tight crispy screenplay by Aamil Keeyan Khan and narration is simply superb. Brilliant mind blowing delivery by underrated Akshay Khanna, blasting performance by Ajay Devgan and promising performance by Kamlesh Sawant as Gaitonde, as usual unparallel by Saurabh Shukla, Rajat Kapoor, Tabbu.Aamil & Abhisek in one place missed the originality and that's ...in front of IG an suspended Gayetondke started slapping Ajay's family which is not possible. There are cameras all over the police station & senior officers can track it. It is against the rule that male officers will physically torture of female suspects. No men's allowed to touch a female even if they are the culprit, only female officers are allowed to handle them. At the time of Ajay's confession the lawyers need to be there because he has the right to ask a lawyer.Any way a Magnificent venture by Director Abhisek Pathak and his Team with marvellous music & background scoring by Devi Sri Prasad.At a costing of 50 crores Film already collected
approx 250 crores.The Film has lot of twist & turnaround..
It was fun to watch.",8/10,Drishyam 2
MehdiRizvi-7867,25 November 2022,Drishyam 2 Will Be A Blockbuster In Bollywood Cinema,"The movie which I was absolutely waiting to see after seeing its part 1 - which was just mind blowing and absolute edge of a thriller. After seeing part 2 trailer the eagerness was much more and did it lived up to the expectations ????I haven't seen Malayalam version of this movie so I won't be comparing with it. This movie has amazing plot with some really outstanding twists and turns. Ajay Devgn, well no one can beat him in this style of acting, his eyes and his body language are dialogues for him. New entrant in this sequel - Akshaye Khanna was outstanding and probably he only could have taken up this role. Cos against AJ's aura everybody would feel like pheeka pakwan. But he stood and he delivered brilliantly. The twists & turns keeps you on the edge of the seat. An important sign of a good thriller is not building suspense but fulfilling the audience with truth at the right time and Drishyam 2 nailed it to the perfection. Credit to story writer for such a brilliant story and great execution by the director too.There are hardly few sequels which were worth making and watching it and this is one of them which you would love to see it. This movie is definitely worth a dekho and that too in theatre only. Nowadays you hardly find people clapping or whistling at the end of the movie, but I witnessed it today and after a very long time for a movie. It's a top notch suspense thriller !!!PS : In the end Vijay Salgaonkar should have been a given a punch line against Gaitonde.",10/10,Drishyam 2
ritikabhola,9 January 2023,Amazing,"We all have already witnessed what happened with vijay's family... and with that same thrill and suspense ... the second part will steal ur heart... though it is a remake of a Malayalam movie but most of us haven't seen that movie so if u haven't watched that film i am sure that u will gonna love this part too as much u love the first part... cast did a amazing job as they did in first part and u will not feel like sequel released after 8 years .. all the actors of the film holded their character so beautifully that is feel like they are living their character life for real and everything is going in continuity... last 15 min of the movie will give u goosebumps and will automatically makes u to give a standing ovation to our fav Vijay Salgaonkar... I deducted 1 star bcz as it is a remake that we can't ignore.. but overall nice screenplay, amazingly written movie and a must watch if u haven't watched it in Malayalam language.

MaverickV,31 December 2022,A mediocre sequel...wasn't required,"I am still not sure the intentions of the makers behind creating this sequel, and then with some clear loopholes in the storyline!!.. there are a few and then there are some weak writing and scenes.They made it so simple, with another person getting release from the jail, same after 7 years when police again started to look deeper into the investigation and very easily some police detective got hold of an evidence (in terms of some taped convo!!! Again the dumbo wife!)And I dont know why! I mean why even in the 21st century we show our wives and daughters so weak, confused and stupid!!! There are scenes which just doesnt make sense to me other than that, writers were lazy to come up with something more creative and stronger.Even after 7 years, the wife and daughter (and I can understand her issue to an extent after the killing episode) just dont seem to understand what has happened. Writers couldn't provide proper character arc for the wife. She doesnt have any depth in the character portrayal and unfortunately writers keep showing her as total dumb, even tho she looks and dresses so smart!!IThis is a story about a parent trying to save the daughter and family, but in typical bollywoodization they made it a One man hero show! I was expecting more depth, better and detailed scenes with strong and creative dialogues, but it was just a whimper, with usual bollywood masala of style over substance... The ending is underwhelming and we should just accept it because yeah it is gullible Indian audience and they are immature and cant control that the protagonist side can have ANY causalities! I Only watched for Tabu and whatever timeframe she was given on screen she did her best. Akshaye is dependable but he wasnt given much to do except to look serious and spit out some heavy dialogues....Try some more Bollywood!... OTT has surely made a difference and we know we have writers, directors, and actors that can lit up the screen with more creative scripts! Better luck next time!",5/10,Drishyam 2
sulakshyamisra,4 December 2022,Next Level Movie...!!!,"Drishyam 1 was already so awesome that wasn't expecting it so be exceptional but I was 100% wrong. This movie is equally great as drishyam 1 and may be better than it. Everything was on point and obviously because it's a sequel of drishyam, so the story was just something else. Acting of Ajay Devgun was also as good as the part1 and keeping the cast same as all the previous cast was also a great move which makes us feel like we're just continuing from exactly where we left. The comeback of akshay kanna was also great, he's a great actor. I'm finally happy to see bollywood doing something good. Anyway, I totally loved it. A must watch movie...!!

WorldMovie99,24 November 2022,Another remake !,"Watch the South version of Drishyam 2. It is outstanding. The thoughts behind the film , the characters, the language , the sentiments should be in tune with one another. Simply remaking won't fulfil the idea of popularizing the film. The hindi version will not touch the entire national mindset. Drishyam 2 south is a masterpiece. So the art and film society should make amends in popularizing this film in malayali with appropriate subtitles in almost all language, english is a must for NE Region.Apart from these Ajay Devagan doesn't fit well in the role of Mohanlal. He is well suited in the role of a criminal or a revolutionary. In part 1 also its the same issue. The idea itself doesn't fit well the Bollywood mindset , also not in tune with its fans. Since a work is done by spending money so a 2/10. But this is not worth !

ankfordeals,3 January 2023,"Amazing remake, a great movie after a long long time","I watched Drishyam 1 in Malyalam and then in Hindi. When Drishyam 2 came out, I decided to watch the hindi version only and I was not wrong. This is genuine effort which has outclassed the Malyalam version. The story keeps you intact and it feels like it should never end. Every character has justified his role and Akshay Khanna is at his best. This movie was all Ajay Devgan and Akshay Khanna's movie and is amazing. Love it and a must watch for sure.I watched on OTT hence the songs were not present and it was all story and acting. When the whole story stitches together, an outstanding story comes out. The satsang was called out and it was the best part.

nitsvirusboyz,18 November 2022,Highly Recommended üëçüèº by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"Drishyam 2 is a well-written sequel and a well-directed remake with some amazing performances. The story of the sequel is also brilliantly written by Jeethu Joseph that is packed with many surprise moments and an applause-worthy climax. Director Abhishek Pathak's last film was Ujda Chaman (2019) and after that, he has shown impressive growth and successfully delivered a faithful remake of a great suspense thriller film.Although the first half of the film was slow-paced, especially in the initial portions but becomes engaging soon due to the performances. The screenplay by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak is gripping in the second half. The audience will be glued to their seats till the end credits. The dialogues and the cinematography were also noteworthy in the film. Rockstar Devi Sri Prasad's background score is exciting and goes well with the thrilling premise of the film.Ajay Devgn, once again, delivers an outstanding performance. He gets back into the skin of the character of Vijay Salgaonkar and does entire justice to the character. Akshaye Khanna was a good choice for the sequel and he delivers a notable performance. Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, and Mrunal Jadhav were fine in their roles. Tabu, Kamlesh Sawant, Rajat Kapoor, and Saurabh Shukla had given decent supporting performances.Drishyam 2 Movie Rating:

avishektask,7 December 2022,Fantastic storyline with mind blowing finish,"This is an wonderful movie. Great storyline, mind blowing finish. And the important part is every actor done justice with the characters they have been allocated for. We have seen very good work by all of the actors in Drishyam part one. Here Akshay Khanna is a new addition in a crucial role of police IG who has re-opened the murder case. And I must say as usual he won't disappoint the audience. The good part is in this movie you never feel that storyline is getting repeated. Here everything is new and one must have to watch the part one for best understanding. But I was expecting some more contribution from an great actor like Saurabh Shukla. Anyways can't get everything from a movie. But I must say this is a full paisa wasool movie.

I was like what is going on what m I watching and why?Then after interval it will get some pace and yes it was almost a good movie but boy do not compare it with its first part. Drishyam was far better like way better than drishyam 2.Ajay was cool but rest of the people failed to put their mark unlike the first part. May be the problem was one will continuously comparing it with its first part.But nonetheless it's a good thriller in this market. Cheers.,7/10,Drishyam 2

The movie started slow but didn't get boring at all during the running time.The twists in the tales are very unexpected and no body can guess what the end would be.A must watch movie.",10/10,Drishyam 2
balchanderbhagwath,28 November 2022,Why should I watch it again!,"After watching the movie I realised bollywood only knows to copy and paste South Indian movies. When the original movie is available online for free why again watch. Yes it was curious to know how different it's made in Hindi. I must say it's the exact scene to scene copy paste. There is nothing new to the original movie. Ajay Devgun is at his pinnacle of his acting whilst Tabu and others have justified their role. The only contest for this rating is for the director who shamelessly copies and tries to market it to other platform. Why can't he think of subject of his own instead of running success from other people. Yes it's a must watch and I recommend everyone to watch if you haven't watched the original Malayalam movie.Don't expect anything different from the original !

rahulkrmtl,11 January 2023,awesome climax,"Drishyam 2 is a story of how a dad and alsso a husband goes to any extent to protect his family. THis movie is an inspiration for all husbands, dad to stand with their family in all times, however worse be the circumstances and never leave the family alone. Nice acting by all the cast. I was really impressed by the acting of grave digger character (I can't find the name on internet-actor name). I was also impressed by the acting of Rajat Kapoor and Akshaye Kahanan and Sarabh Shukla and Kamlesh Sawant in the film. Very nice performances by all the cast. FIlm story was intriguing, engaging, thrilling, full os suspense. You won't know till the end what the picture climax will finally turn out to be. I also liked the songs and music of the film. Very nice lyrics and music. Lyrics and beats well matched to the situations in the movie. FIlm cinematography, editing was sharp nice not boring at all. You will get hooked to the story throughout watching the movie. I had a great time watching the movie. This movie started only with so much thrill and ended also in a suspense end. I really liked the message in the end of the film by AJay Devagan that even after he tries to defend his family he cannot watch eye to eye with the father of the boy their family has killed. This movie dialogue were also touching and really well written. I cannot remember that dialogue that I really liked. Very nice dialogues of the film. Story was also very nice, full of twists and turns. I had a really nice time watching this film. Really recommend you to watch this film. This is a paisa wasool film. Everything you get in this film, family story, drama, crime and murder mystery and a whole lot of suspense. I rate this movie 8 stars out of 10. I would recommend even more stars for the film. Not to forget Ajay Devgan and Shriya Sharan and Tabu being the main cast hold the story of the movie really well on their shoulders. Ishit Durra was also good. Mrunal Jadhav was cute. Siddharth Bodke one more star actor to watch out for.",9/10,Drishyam 2
jhaprakhar,3 December 2022,Ajay proves that content is king!!!!!,"Just came out of the theatres,and I am shocked, speechless at such an impeccable film! The way the story progresses,the tension brought in by akshaye khanna,Ajay Devgan's eyes,the brilliance of Tabu! And the most shocking plot twist you will ever witness! Don't miss this film in the theatres,otherwise you would be kicking yourself when you see it in a smaller screen! Brilliant! The music of DSP,the crisp editing,gaitonde sahab stealing the show,and some impeccable references to the original. This film will have its status as a cult classic,just like the first part. I know it's too early,but can't wait for the third part!!!

SoumikBanerjee25,30 December 2022,Competent Storytelling but not without its flaws,"I have been (and continue to be) one of the few loyalists who would rather see the Bollywood version of the sequel than the original Malayalam thriller (this may sound strange but people like us exist too).As a fan of Bollywood's version of Drishyam, I had purposefully waited months to witness this second instalment in theatres. However, due to some urgent issues at the time of release, I was unable to! Since then, I have been patient and waited for my turn to see it on the streaming site, and today, when it was finally made available on Amazon Rent, I immediately started watching.In no way, shape, or form is the storytelling flawless. There are, in fact, quite a few flaws against which you can present arguments. Nonetheless, this succeeds in numerous ways. The performances are strong, the score matches the bill, and the script, despite its modest imperfections, gave enough moments of suspense and surprise.My only big complaint is with the film's beginning, where the build-up takes center - stage and the organic progression takes a back seat. It took a substantial amount of time to start moving, but once it did (literally, when Akshay Khanna enters the frame), there was no turning back! Everything was set in action as it was intended.",7/10,Drishyam 2
suryanshpriyam-33834,20 November 2022,Hats OFF Sir üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéâ,"Hi everyone. Please go watch this!! This is worth your money and time. If not watched, please watch the first part on Netflix or Prime Video.(in order to watch the second one). When you go watch this, first half is very much introducing new characters. Second half is very these characters are very useful and help build the suspense. Very solid acting by Akshaye and Ajay sir. Tabu ma'am's acting is very good and helpful. All rest of the family's acting was very solid. The story, plot and everyone acting will blow your mind. The climax is the nail biting part and where it will blow your mind. Once again, hats off!!!!

arungeorge13,31 December 2022,Not a frame-to-frame remake.. enjoyably crisp! [+73%],"This remake stays mostly faithful to its source material, trimming some of its soapy flab, and making it crisper and engaging. One thing I didn't quite like is how Ajay Devgn remains wooden throughout the highs and lows of the film. Mohanlal in the original was subtle, but you notice a sense of brewing trouble in his body language the first time he's cornered. Tabu is the consistent performer here, and her presence is not scattered unlike Asha Sharath's. Akshaye Khanna also puts up an enigmatic show as the IG, offering the right balance between clever and intimidating. The major plot points are left intact, so the climactic scenes didn't surprise me. That said, the writing decision to bring back Gaitonde was a good move.

nadkarnisumeet,25 November 2022,Perfect as a sequel as well as remake!!,"Drishyam 2 review :A direct sequel to Nishikant Kamat directed Drishyam (2015) and a remake of its Malayalam namesake released on OTT last year, Drishyam 2 turns out to be watch worthy on both fronts - sequel as well as remake. Infact, this is one of the best remakes seen in Bollywood after a long time.Cut to the plot, Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) is living a peaceful life with his family gradually tiding over the crisis they faced seven years ago. It is only when the newly transferred cop Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna) comes to his town and re-opens Sam's missing case that Vijay and his family get in to trouble once again. Tarun is Meera (Tabu)'s ex-colleague and close friend and he vows to nail Vijay at any cost. But can he?!!Staring with a slow pace, the film skyrockets once Akshaye Khanna enters the frame and trust me, his introduction scene got as much ceetis and taalis as Ajay Devgn got earlier. The twist just before the interval is fantastic and the second half turns in to a practical hide and seek game which is truly fun to watch.The performances are first rate. Ajay literally shoulders the film on his own. Akshaye Khanna leaves a mighty impression as the investigating officer. Tabu shines even in a small role while Shriya Saran looks gorgeous even in a modest saree.Drishyam 2 is a thoroughly engaging fare which serves as a perfect sequel to first part. Personally, I found Mohanlal's original slightly better but this Hindi adaptation is also worth your ticket price. Book early as the shows are full.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",8/10,Drishyam 2
akshatmahajan,9 January 2023,A decent sequel,"The original movie was a good suspense thriller drama and one of the remakes which was executed properly. The story, screenplay, acting, suspense, thrill, drama, direction, execution everything was good. If I talk about the sequel, it felt the same as the first. The screenplay and execution felt little bit weak as compared to the original but overall everything was good or above average. One thing which I personally didn't like was the pacing of the movie. At some times, it felt like movie was too slow and in some scenes, it felt fast. In other words, the pacing was uneven.Overall, it was a good movie which you should definitely give a try after watching the first part.

SumanShakya,15 January 2023,A taut thriller which sets a franchise....,"""Drishyam"" was a taut thriller with some unexpected twists with a common man fending his family from law when his daughter accidentally commits a murder. The case is reopened after 7 years in this sequel, which is equally compelling and surprising to its prequel.The film just continues the saga with the same backdrop and characters, and the sequel retains the same freshness of the first part. Despite a different director and the time lapse, the film perfectly gels with the first part and nowhere feels a different territory which most of the sequels feel. The first half is a bit slow with the background getting built up with the reminiscence of the first part. The second half is fully surprising with the viewers left to ponder on what went reprising repeated viewings. Perhaps it sets a franchise in family thrillers with a next sequel to be anticipated in ""Drishyam"" franchise. Overall, the tremendous performances, family theme, and the low profile it keeps turns into a masterpiece.Rating: 3 stars out of 4.",7/10,Drishyam 2
amitprajapati-83981,19 November 2022,Average movie,"I like drishyam one comparison of drishyam 2. When I watched drishyam 2 in theaters I didn't feel any excitement. First half of movie was so boring but Second half little bit ok comparison of first half. All characters was same except ( akshya khanna) Ajay devgan acting was so poor comparison of akshya khanna. Akshya khanna was Trump card of this movie. We felt so excitement after akshya khanna entry. Music and song of movies was not good. But this movies a family movies we can easily watch this movie with family no adult sence in this movie. Drishyam one was blockbuster because that time no one knew it this was a remake of South Indian movies. Nowadays bollywood are just focusing in remake of movie.

When akshay khanna comes to screen and starts reopened the case and filed, finding buried corpse when tabu appears it was best moment in movie but it's not that good as we expect from ajay devgan films it's literally frame to frame same as mohanlal drishyam release on Amazon Prime just 1 year ago
And come to the direction abhishek pathak should learn how to direct films how to shoot he just spoiled the film by his stupid direction and ideology we must want this movie get success in box office
Why bollywood keeps remaking now remakes won't work at all hindi cinema should take care of themselves otherwise bollywood will disappear only original content can save bollywood otherwise it can only be seen in web series on ott

Most likely they had nothing to really do and being bored sitting home during COVID and just want to write something up.......Drishyam was way better and gripping tale and on the edge Thriller.Drishyam 2 on the other hand, just doesn't make any sense, stretched out and very predictable....Acting was Good, Story was just a so so.....The guy who was in Jail, remembered seeing Ajay 7 years back after midnight in the dark, had showel in hand....walking out of the Police Station.....I mean SERIOUSLY!!!Let me repeat.....7 years back, after midnight, he remembered the exact location when they building was getting constructed.....he knew the spot 7 years later and Ajay's face in the dark with little light.....Doesn't really make sense.....I mean just showing whatever comes in the writer's head.....Way OverHyped Movie and nothing else.....",4/10,Drishyam 2

First of all I haven't seen the original one so I can easily say this movie is an amazing experience for me. Movie starts where the 1st part ended but with the leap of 7 years. First half takes time to set up the scenerio as it should be but the entry of AKSHAYE KHANNA is where the fun begins. Totally unpredictable story with edge of the seat thriller experience. Everything is going on in front of you but still you can't even predict the single thing and that's the beauty of this movie. AJAY DEVGN is in insane form in this movie as the rest of the cast. Well as compared to 1st Drishyam second is little slow as it takes time to set up but still you can easily skip that portion of the film. If you are a thriller fan don't skip this. It's a must watch if you haven't seen the original.....

vincinnum,18 November 2022,Good but the Malayalam version is so much better,"This is a sentence for sentence remake of the Malayalam movie - Drishyam 2. Ajay has delivered fine acting and some supporting casts are good too overall but dialogues aren't on par with the Malayalam version. Even editing, music, and build-up of the twists/suspense is better in the Malayalam movie.Still, it's a worthy remake. If you don't want to watch the original with an English subtitle, definitely go for this movie.Talking about the movie, I'd say that it's as good as Drishyam-1, if not better. Few can predict that story like it unfolds. You'll know when you see it.I hope the makers go for another sequel - a part 3 - because this movie definitely has a built a good fanbase.

waheedgb-73530,19 November 2022,Dialogues could have been better,"The first movie was far better in terms of dialogues and dialogue delivery. Drishyam 2 feels dry and unemotional. Let's talk about each aspect of the movie one by one.Cast:The IG: Akashay was a good choice for the role but he should have been in his uniform as it could have given more power to his character. Plus, he was supposed to be serious, not funny.The shadow police: The two actors were not fit for the roles. The actors in the Malayalam version were a much better choice and they performed a lot better.The eye witness: Again, he was unsuitable for the role. The guy in the Malyalam version was a better choice.Former IG: Tabu should have been a little more worried and upset but his was expressionless half the time. So, I was unable to connect with the mother emotionally.Songs and background music:The songs were all forgettable as they were not enjoyable at all. Unlike Drishyam 1, the background music was not thrilling or suspenseful, which reduced the impact of intense situations in the film. I found the music pretty boring.Dialogues:The original 2015 film was fantastic in terms of dialogue and dialogue delivery but this one falls flat in this department. In the first film, every dialogue was catchy, powerful and beautifully delivered.Direction: This is one of the biggest flaws of this sequel. The new director failed to make the actors express their emotions in each situation. The actors' faces were almost flat even in intense situations.The first director could have done much better if he were alive. So, I think the director was a wrong choice for this film.So, I will give 5 out of 10 points to this film. It's a nice one-time watch unlike the first movie that I have watched a dozen times without. It was a perfect movie from all angles.Go watch this sequel as it's still better than a lot of Bollywood movies released over the past 10 years.",5/10,Drishyam 2
ayushparasar,15 January 2023,Slowly builds up to a great climax,"Whenever there's a sequel of a super hit film, there's this added expectation from it and makers are constantly reminded of it, and most of the time, they try to follow the same formula that worked the last time around.Unlike Drishyam, which keeps you invested right from starting, this one is a relatively slow starter, and there are a few moments in which your mind can wander off. But with Akshaye Khanna's entry, the script picks up pace. He is intimidating yet subtle. With him enters Gaitonde! At some point, he says he can forget his wife's birthday, but he cannot forget the events of 2nd and 3rd October, lol; the guy despises Vijay and his family, which hasn't changed in all these years. More than anyone else, Gaitonde made me want to watch the first film again.The climax feels rewarding, and it logically places all the pieces in place, which I think has become a trademark of this franchise.""Shabdo pe nahi, drishyon pe dhyaan do, kyuki shabdo mein jhoot chupne ki jagah dhoond hi leta hai, lekin drishya. . . Drishya kabhi jhoot nahi bolte. Isliye,
Sawaal ye nahi ke aapki aankho ke saamne kya hai. . .,

tarekali-19909,15 January 2023,hard to imagine topping the genius of the original,"It is hard to imagine topping the genius of the original, or even exceeding it, but this sequel has succeeded. Once again the brilliant Vijay finds himself battling with the ghosts of past sins, except this time the grim reaper is the new, determined Inspector General Tarun, played well by Khanna. I am impressed they brought back all the old players and seamlessly jumped ahead 7 long years. I am even more blown away at how Vijay anticipated exactly how these threats would play out, down to the minutest detail. This time his manipulation of illusion extends beyond the local game to the system itself. His enemies never stood a chance, so well thought out is his every move, so well crafted the narrative defenses around his little world. There is a nice touch of closure to this sequel, with human kindness between enemies. It is hard to imagine how they can extend this amazing series to a 3rd installment.

kainatrc,9 January 2023,Superb movie,"This movie is the continuation of the first part and yes it has justified the continuation. You can say beautifully crafted and well executed. The movie's original version was out almost a year back. If someone has not watched the original they would find this interesting but if you watch it in original Malyalam version,you may find a different spicy flavor. This bollywood version is equally interesting and has its own flavor. But if you want more go for the Malyalam version,its on Amazon Prime. The ending is same but the second half of the movie is different. Watch both the version, they are available on amazon Prime,the Malyalam version is available with Prime membership and for bollywood version wait a little or you can rent the movie. Dont miss either of them. Both has their own flavour and will entertain you completely.

Watch the failure of powerful & intelligent investigative effort and still feel satisfied with the climax.Ajay Devgn, Tabbu, Akshay Khanna, & Kamlesh Sawant delivers their character so well. Others were just supporting characters who either didn't get enough to show their part and lack their convincing ability. I wish if Ajay Devgan had actually kept his look from the first film.

Niraj_Solanki,21 November 2022,"Same as Malyalam, Not a single change in Original Script/Story","A well made remake and film succeeds to enthrall audience for sure. Primely it's a remake however sadly a scene to scene copy and also shot / filmed at very similar locations without any single change in original script! So those who have already seen Drishyam 2 of southern industry wouldn't find any newness. But yes those who haven't seen original would find this film exceptional and enjoy all the twists and turns more jubilantly. Film also maintains the seriousness towards it's storyline and makers have not added any unwanted spices which is good.Ajay Devgan, Akshay Khanna, Tabu, Shriya Saran and entire star cast has done a fabulous job on screen. AjayD looks rock solid with his acting & AkshayK steals the show with his killing expressions and dialogues. Tabu, ShriyaS and Ishita Dutta have made their presence felt with superb performances. Specifically ShriyaS dominates the emotional scenes by bringing the right kind of expressions on face. So casting is very apt here.Coming to the storyline then film shows the whole recap of first part in title credits and the same case reopens thereafter as Tabu & her husband RajatK visits India to perform some rituals for their son's death. AkshayK takes the charge and with his brilliance and aid from an eye-witness he finds out that body buried inside police station. He catches AjayD's family and tortures them inside prison and get the confession out. Now will AjayD be able to save himself and his family or not forms the crux of the film.As I said before, the script is kept unchanged, scene sequences are identical and film progresses in very similar way. Nevertheless film wins in all other cinematic aspactilike Dialogues, BGM, Screenplay, Direction, etc. I also liked the two songs and off the beat music of DSP here. Overall film offers nothing new as compared to the original and I would like to give it 3 / 5 (üåüüåüüåü) to it.*What I Liked Most -* The Chess Scene (Entry Scene of Akshay Khanna)*By - Niraj Solanki..!*",6/10,Drishyam 2
chetansoni-32481,20 November 2022,Drishyam 2 is worth watching,"Absolute gem.Top performance specially by Shriya Saran. Her expressions were top notch. Without uttering a dialogue she made the scene so cinematic as per the scene.Ajay devgan, tabu, akshaye khana, rajat kapoor, ishita dutta were good.Though its a scene to scene copy from mohanlal drishyam but performances were top notch. Those woh liked the drishyam 1 would definitely love this 2nd part.Music and Bgm was good.This part is directed by abhishek pathak and he has done good job. 1st part was directed by nishikant kamat who died of covid last year.Theatres were full today when i watched this. Saw the crowd again after bhool bhulaiyya 2.",10/10,Drishyam 2
solankiharry,18 November 2022,Visuals Can Be Deceptive !! Drishyam 2 Packs A Punch ...,"The sequel begins where the first part ends - with the murder case of Samir Deshmukh, son of IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu), closed as 'unresolved'. The new top cop in town (Akshaye Khanna) reopens the file much to the agony of Vijay Salgaongar (Ajay Devgn) and his family who inadvertently gets embroiled in the case. The real hero of 'Driysham 2' is the cleverly written plot (Joseph), and the twists and turns incorporated at the right times before a befitting climax, which may not be as novel or notorious as in part one, but is nevertheless equally captivating due to its ingenuity. The suspense is heightened by some good acting by the entire cast which is easily relatable. One can feel their tribulations and trauma as the Salgoankar family go through another extended and excruciating round of police investigation as well as close scrutiny by their neighbours.Repeated close-up shots of the leading characters and effective use of slow motion scenes add extra impact to an intense plot which ebbs and flows right through.In the seven-year gap since 'Driysham', Vijay Salgoankar, the 'Chauthi Fail Aam Aadmi' and a complete Family Man, has moved on from being a cable operator to a theatre owner and a potential producer of a film while Meera Deskmukh is now retired but still in the hunt to find the killers of her only son Samir.Akshaye Khanna as the new police chief enters the scene from where he left off in Sridevi-starrer Mom, all the mannerisms included. His role and that of Saurabh Shukla as a writer, is a welcome addition to a tightly knitted star cast and adds a new element of suspense. Shukla as expected blends with his character despite limited time and space. Khanna, on the other hand, is suave and sensitive as a police chief hell bent on solving a complex murder case.You will enjoy 'Driysham 2' better if you watch it without any needless distractions, like, for example, wasting time on finding faults in it.",9/10,Drishyam 2
sujanmaharjan-10194,18 November 2022,Just a perfect duplicate of Mohan Lal's original!!,"Bollywood is remaking south movies and think that people will throng to cinema Hall to see their ""so called"" stars to re-enacting other's original work. But, these tricks no more work on intelligent movie lovers. Story is already known, mystery is already revealed, then who will go to watch flop actors like Ajay devgan who has not given a single bollywood hit in many years except cameo on RRR which is also a south movie. Better watch Drishyam 2, kantara or RRR again than to watch this duplicate!! The trend of making remakes of south movies and nothing original on its sleeve is hurting Bollywood and movie goers like us!!

fmramn,29 November 2022,Fabulous story!,"The story and plots are very strong and unpredictable. Made without many annoying songs. I got a wonderful experience after this move. The climax always gives goosebumps.The first half of the movie is a little slow but the second half is just the main fun of the movie.I would say, although the first half was slow but it was necessary for the film. Every character also the character who has the least roll in the film has a important motive in the story which is disclosed in the second half. The actors did ther job perfectly but the person who informed the police about a important thing his acting was not perfect but average. But the acting of the lead character's wife was awesome.Should definitely watch it!",9/10,Drishyam 2
dhruvinsoni-77539,19 November 2022,Nail biting thriller,"How often do you see everyone clapping in the climax of the movie or twist in the movie? Drishyam 2 is a brilliant thriller and engaging!The performance delivered by Ajay Devgan & Akshaye Khanna is just out of the box and fabulous to watch. The screen presence of Tabu and Rajat Kapoor adds the extra spice in the movie. Apart from that the performance by Shriya Saran & Ishita Dutta is also good. The cinematography, the cameo by Saurabh Shukla will blow your mind. The first half is bit slow but you will never feel bored. The movies increases the speed and and grip in the second half. A must watch!

drvmxxt,22 November 2022,Below Expectations,"Okay so the story, plot and twists in Drishyam 1 led to a lot of expectations from Drishyam 2.The movie is an absolute thriller yes, but could not live up to the expectations. The entire movie is only about the last 40-45 mins. Rest of the movie just explains you what happened in the first part. I understand that the backstory is important but telling it 3-4 times does not make sense.There is only one major twist in the story and that is also somewhat predictable.All in all, a decent movie but did not live up to the expectations created from the first part. (See I repeated the same thing again, it's annoying right? The movie does the same :)

cinephilereviewz,7 December 2022,A great end to a mesmerizing story.,"To fully enjoy this movie, you need to watch the first movie. While the first movie delivers a very neat and fitting ending, it seems that the story hasn't finished yet!Drishyam 2 gives a brief recap of what happens in the first movie through its opening credits. All the dramatic scenes are shown as slideshow to entice you. As you watch the movie, the overall first half of the movie is just a setup for the upcoming twist which comes in as the intermission roles in.The second half is more thrilling as your mind races through how the movie will end! The final punch is delivered in the last 40-30 mins which will make your brain go through a rollercoaster ride. The pay off is immense and makes you admire the writing.Personally for me i thought the setup was too long. There are lots of silence, pauses and slow shots which serves to lengthen the movie. But, the payoff at the end made it worth it.If you haven't watched the first one yet, take sometime out this weekend, watch the first one and then go to the theatre to watch this fine piece of movie.",8/10,Drishyam 2
rafathsiraj,24 November 2022,#Drishyam 2 Ajay Devgan is creating a legacy in Hindi.Review by M. Siraj,"#Drishyam 2 Ajay Devgan is creating a legacy in Hindi. Review by M. SirajThe beautifully encrusted Crime Drishyam 2 released in Hindi, the perpetual investigating story of Jeethu Joseph about a common indomitable man to protect his family till his last breath.Undoubtedly #Ajay Devgan and Shreya gave their best performance in their career for this film, I could not keep myself from comparing it with the Malayalam Version. Mohan Lal with his minute expressions keep the audience with crossed fingers, namely, when he come out from the Court room, seeing the Shadow Police with direct eyes for their no trustworthiness, lowering his eyes when he sees SP and her husband because of his guilty feelings, moreover his financial progress from an ordinary Cable operator to a theatre owner is convincingly narrated by #Jeethu Joseph, whereas Ajay Devgan's financial progress is something abnormal.Secondly, screen play has been changed, (may be to tune with Hindi Audience) but original screenplay in Malayalam was one of the best. The character of Kalabhavan Mani is not coming in the second part, but in Hindi that character (Kamlesh Sawant) appears again, to corner Ajay Devgan with full of venom. Regarding the role of Police SP played by Tabu simply overshadowing Nadiya Moidu with her look and perseverance in taking vengeance on Ajay Devgan, specifically her dialogues with the Poojari on her son's yearly death day.Finally, #AkshyeKhanna as IG gave a spectacular effect on the screen, but in Malayalam version Introduction of Murali Gopi as IG and the two Mohan Lal neighbours as Shadow Police pulls up the heart beat of the Audience for its unexpected twist, which is missing in Hindi.Finally, those who have not seen #Malayalam Drishyam 2, the #Hindi version definitely make you thrill and no doubt, it is going to be a Blockbuster in Hindi.Watched Drishyam 2 Hindi at Jeddah Al Andalus Mall, Empire Cinema.",7/10,Drishyam 2
Koustubh_Juvekar,11 December 2022,The story and linking is very good! Something good after a long time from bollywood!,"A very good movie! There are so many twists before the interval and at the end as well! The story is good and well linked. Especially climax, its just mind-blowing and no one can ever guess what exactly Vijay is going to do and how! Overall it was a great experience and I think it has maintained that high class, where we could see the story is not flowing out of the way, no chaos and no unnecessary actions; music, cinematic view, shooting, acting, direction everything is excellent, and running calm and cool! I would say, bollywood has given something good after a long time! Drishyam 1 and 2, both are good movies. Interesting.. Must watch! üòä 8.5/10.

It's a Justified Sequel and gives a Paisa Vasool Experience due to its Power-Packed Performances By Powerhouse Actors,Scripts and clap-Worthy Climax.What Makes Drishyam 2 a BIG SCREEN experience is the dialogues and top notch background score by DSP.Ajay Devgan Excels as Vijay Salgaonkar again in this Expertly Crafted Sequel, Akshaye Khanna is a Impactful addition to the Franchise. His Face-off moments with Ajay Devgn are Amazing.Kamlesh Sawant as Gaitonde is Simply Hilarious and brilliant. Shriya Saran does a good job as Nandini, who is more vulnerable this time. Ishita Dutta shines as Anju once again in her scenes. Saurabh Shukla adds loads of spice and flavour to Drishyam 2.There's no need for fancy words to describe Tabu's supremacy. Meera Deshmukh is an iconic character that is a part of history, all thanks to the actress and her brilliance.Abhishek Pathak's attempt is Genuine.Keep your Mobile Phone Away Bcz Every Small details is Important.DRISHYON pe DHYAAN Do !!",10/10,Drishyam 2
ravi-unadkat,18 November 2022,Almost perfect thriller,"This movie is pure magic. We don't see such simple story telling which is so complex, detailed and well thought in nature.Each character has a role to play and is an integral part of the entire movie. I don't see a single scene which was forced or out of place.Overall awesome story, writing, screenplay, background score, acting - almost everything except few loose ends. I guess those loose ends are intended to lead us to part 3.Ajay Devgn, Akshaye Khanna, Tabu and rest all casts steal the show.Story has a nice built up and they spent good time to establish the world. Post interval the movie gets into its zone and leave you speechless at the climax.It's all about true content and genuine acting.Recommended!",9/10,Drishyam 2

I want everyone to watch this movie series. So I will tell all my friends to watch this movie. I understand that you have worked hard to make this movie. Thank you very much for that Movie. I don't know what else to comment. Actually I have to write 500 characters so I am trying to write more. And this movie will surely be less than the good things I say about it.

tejassawant13,21 November 2022,One of the finest suspense thriller movies after long time.,"No spoiler review. The film begins in the same timeline as the first Drishyam movie. This second installment of the series has a potential grip from its first minute. Throughout the runtime of the movie, every scene has its own meaning.The film takes a bit of time to set you up with the world and story we left off 7 years ago and it's worth it.What I liked the most in this movie is every single character from the first and second installments has something to do with the storyline.And when each character plays an important role in the movie it makes the movie so engaging.If you want to enjoy the ending of the movie, Don't miss the beginning.Direction: We miss the touch of Nishikant Kamat here but Abhishek Pathak has done a phenomenal job in direction. Suspense thriller movies mostly depend upon screenplay and direction and Abhishek Pathak has given justice to his work.Writing: Written by Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak. Script and screenplay are the kings of this Franchise. Perfect writing.Cinematography: The cinematography is good. Cinematographer Sudhir K. Chaudhary has done good camera work. The framing, Composition, and color palette are so beautiful. It sets the tone of the movie from the first frame.Music and sound design: Songs are not so catchy but fine. The background score is so awesome. The background score plays perfectly in each scene. Especially when the time the Salgaonkar family interacts with the police.Thank You.",10/10,Drishyam 2
gaurijalan,6 January 2023,Unresolved Limitations,"Drishyam 2 is a fair remake of the original malayalam movie, however, it would have been better if it would have worked to resolve the loopholes that were present in the original one. Thus, the film automatically ends up falling in a trap that lacks originality of its own, despite the performances of great actors like Tabu and even Ajay Devgan. The film is not bad but from a personal point of view, I feel like I should have waited for this film to release on an ott platform rather than paying for the ticket. The only novel aspect was Akshaye Khanna's role who ruled the screen and definitely saved the play.

charaadnan,20 November 2022,"outstanding edge of the seat thriller,","#Drishyam2Review - First thing first - A HOUSEFUL Sunday morning show in itself looked like a treat for an ardent movie lover like yours truly.Jeetu Joseph's original story of Drishyam 2 has been remade into an outstanding edge of the seat thriller, specially the 2nd half. Vijay Salgaonkar continues his mission to save his family in a story where screenplay just flows organically, the twists induces seeties & the climax just blows your mind. Tight screenplay that never ever deviates from building the climax, astute direction, crisp editing and most importantly, the original caste of Drishyam retained entirely is a master stroke. All actors deliver to the promise.

manishkmr-95555,8 January 2023,"Very long build up, equally short climax","The build up took way too long for my liking, i mean I'm glad they did not waste too much time in flashbacks but still, took way too long to get to the ending ,which, itself was nice but it was so brief and so quick that I couldn't enjoy it as luch as i would've liked. Unlike the first Drishyam, there wasn't much time to absorb and enjoy whatever was happening in Drishyam 2. I wish they paced it down (the ending) and detailed it a bit more so that the audience wouldn't be left trying to grasp everything everywhere all at once. The performances were nice though but apart from Akshaye Khanna it did not feel very new. Overall, just feel it could have been better.

swarupcsc,20 November 2022,most deserving sequel..best movie of 2022,"The main thing in this movie is the story it hook up you to the screen till it's ending. Acting, direction and all the little things to the point and logical. Not like any other Bollywood movie where everything is over the top but here story is well grounded and characters are quite believable and acting of all the star cast is big round of applause. Go and watch this movie you will never regret. The main USP of this movie is continuity from part 1 all the characters are same and the story is that moves perfectly and 2nd half of the movie is edge of the seat drama and mystery that unfold and compell you to stand and applaud for the character.

nynvaidya,24 November 2022,Appreciating PVR - nice seats to sleep,"Why these people don't use brains at all while doing remake? No change from original movie. Copy same to same. Thanks to PVR and it's wonderful recliner seats, I could slept for almost for an hour. Super pathetic direction.No comparison in Malayalam and Hindi movie. Original remains original. Mohanlal is baap of all. Ajay Devgan isn't even 1% of him. Direction : this new kid (director of Hindi movie), he was not able to copy properly. He used his own thoughts and concepts (very very few, as they don't want to take risk) - but that's the disaster.Better to see this on OTT in few days. Don't waste money.Note - I'm writing this review from movie hall watching movie and there's nothing in movie that catches attention.

YUCK like I said...if you still do watch it without having watched the much better OG than you may just like it because our standards are that f low these days....if I have to surmise my last 2 precious hours I would say EEW to everyone and everything in this rubbish parody!

vjtharki,31 December 2022,3rd rate remake of a brilliant original,"This's another example of Bollywood going nuts with a foolproof original. They have to go off template & add their stupid extras to make it look more appealing to the masses. Little do they realize that the masses have already evolved over time with an overdose of OTT content. Stop treating the common man as an idiot who'll just lapup anyhing that you dish out in the name of entertainment. If at all you're so creatively bankrupt that you need to buy a story, then just leave it as it us & don't try to add your stupid bhaiyya ideas to it. Don't forget that you had to make a remake because you never had the brains to make something remotely close to the original.

vivek28593,21 November 2022,A dish with an extra teaspoon of masala,"I haven't seen the Malayalam version of Drishyam 1 and 2, so my review is just restricted to the Hindi versions.First of all, a shorter movie would have been better. They could have stripped the story of all the unnecessary frills and delivered the movie in two acts: one where the body is discovered, and two, where Vijay escapes yet again.Honestly, we were all expecting that the body would somehow be discovered, all we were waiting for is to see how Vijay would escape yet again. They could have focused on that part more. Instead, the escape is restricted to the final quarter of the film.The final quibble I have with the movie is the casting of Akshaye Khanna in his role. The movie was telling us that the new IG was supposed to be more dangerous, cunning, and intelligent than the previous one, but the only thing he does in the movie to prove this is have a weird conversation with Vijay's wife. Think about it, what else does he do in the movie other than giving funny stares and playing chess with himself? If this dark, mysterious, and dangerous appearance was what the movie was going for, Akshaye Khanna wasn't the actor for this role.I liked the twists in the story, but felt that it could have been made simpler. At times, there were stories within stories, which was maybe unnecessary. I am a fan of murder mysteries, and also a fan of the cheesy 'last-person-you-think-has-done-it.' But I still left the movie feeling that there was something extra, like a teaspoon of masala in an otherwise perfect dish.",8/10,Drishyam 2
voodoodex-19167,26 November 2022,good remake,"Is anyone even taking the pains to making art? Music is remade, whole movies are remade. Moving on from the rant, the writing is tad one dimensional, very causal flow of the story, up until the setup is ready to gp full explosive climax. The music seems to be good since inspired from stravinsky. Although the mix is tad loud to have a clear audio reception of different dialogues. The cinematography is quite good and effective at storytelling. Some plots are writing just to ascertain that it would be used later on in the story, that's what felt like loose and unpolished setups. Dialogues felt tad unrealistic.

sakkumits,18 November 2022,A Good watch if you haven't watched the original.,"1st half is dragged but that's for setting up the stage for second half. Suspense is well written but you somewhat guess it with the people slowly appearing throughout the first half. Background music is good when compared to that in 1st part but the songs and good music is missing.If we talk about acting, all actors have acted pretty good especially Shriya Saran. She is pretty good in few of the scenes. And Ajay is an actor known for acting through his eyes and that comes out in the movie here too.Could have been dragged a bit less but as its a copy paste of the original that is expected already.

drsaketk,27 November 2022,Good movie but falls just short of 1st part,"Very good movie. Though 1st was a masterpiece and this one almost matches the 1st one though falling just short. While 1st one was giving twists every few mins, this one goes at a relatively slow pace with just 1 twist leading to climax. Climax is quite interesting though. Ajay Devgan does what he does best. Akshay Khanna has always been a great actor no matter which role he plays. Tabu is wasted big time here. Shriya sarans dialogue delivery could have been better. Movie keeps you engaged during akshay Khanna scenes and climax but gets bit boring during 1st half due to slow pace with which story goes ahead.

shivendrakumar-64505,20 November 2022,2nd part manages to match the 1st part,"Drishyam 2 is engaging, crisp, and keeps you on the hook till the very end. Also keeps some premise open for the 3rd/last part of this franchise.Movie took first half to establish the premise of the new plot and introduces news charactes . Second half has enough twist and turn to blow your mind.Even after watching the original Malayalam part it doesn't bore you because of fine performance of all the lead cast.Special mention to Akshay Khanna (whom I consider a very under-utilised actor in this industry) who just blow your mind with his acting. The scene in Vijay home where he initimidates Vijay's family was a top notch performance. Tabu and Ajay Devgan as usual gives a top performance as both these performers have depth in their eyes.The background music of Devi Prasad is top notch.The director Abhishek Pathak justifies his credibility and you don't miss nishikant kamat (director of drishyam 1).",8/10,Drishyam 2
truthfinderalways,15 January 2023,Was worth the wait,"First of all kudos to makers for proper sequel and not just part 2 to make money out of established franchise, after first part there were some questions unanswered like what happens to both families after such traumatic incident, is happily ever after possible? So rightly shown in part 2 the PTSD caused to elder daughter, and that too without wasting much time . The song ""kya re zindagi"" was missed offcourse, it's counterpart in Drishyam 2 was not as effective so i instead played kya re zindgi when this song was going to relive gulzar's magic. There are two kinds of thrillers one is like cat and mice race so both parties are equally having their moments and another is like "" sau sunar ki ek lohar ki"" where protagonist is victim throughout the plot only to have last laugh as winner this movie is second kind , but no where u feel bored of family getting constantly oppressed, the major reason was akshaye Khanna's superb witty acting skills and ofcourse Tabu family's too.I had watched drishyam Hindi and loved it. Since I read about the talks of having second part in malyalam version i was very excited but I wanted to watch Hindi version only , the only reason is attachment that you feel with the characters and actors playing it ( of course malyalam version must be great). And i m not the theatre guy, i don't like watching such intense movies with public around whistling and disturbing , so i kept my patience till today for almost 9 years to watch it on Ott and tell you what, it was worth the wait. After long and i mean really long time i felt i watched a good bollywood movie.Note- This is not being slave of moments, it's really good.",10/10,Drishyam 2
riteshsahay,4 December 2022,Desperate attempt,"Forcing the suspense, over dramatic. Our cinemas need fresh ideas not some old bogus thriller. Ajay needs to revamp or he will perish soon with his boring acts. If one wants to sleep in theatre, this one can help. Can watch it at home though on Amazon may be. Its nowhere near to part1. Director has tried using some thrilling sound effects which is only to create the mood and glue the audience. Side actors play an important role. Negative shade needed better approach. Tabu definitely could be more intense along with Akshay Khanna who was not really creating any screen chemistry. Hope they aren't planning for part3!!

kumarrishav-75638,22 November 2022,"overall, Drishyam2 is worthy sequel to 2015 s Drishyam which should be applauded for its skillful writing, brilliant performances and astounding climax.","Ajay Devgn's Drishyam, released in 2015, was simply superb which was an official remake of Malayalam film Drishyam starring Mohanlal thanks to its thundering climax and electrifying screenplay.While the first film was directed by late Nishikant Kamat, Abhishek Pathak returns to the director's chair with slow-burn and yet engaging story written brilliantly by Jeetu Joseph with twist and turns enough to keep you at bay. Drishyam 2 starts off on a slow note but gathers the steam towards the second half. The series of events infuses life to the film and will keep you guessing with what-will-happen-next scenes. Of course, the editing could have better reducing the duration of the film, especially in the first half.It is the last one hour of the film which makes it an interesting watch thanks to the outstanding climax. The only actor who could match to the calibre of Mohanlal is Ajay Devgn . The actor expresses adequately through his eyes and gives a stunning performance. Akshaye Khanna is just turning out to be fabulous with each and every role he plays and this one is definitely on the radar. Tabu and Shriya Saran's character could have been better written.So, overall, Drishyam2 is worthy sequel to 2015 s Drishyam which should be applauded for its skillful writing, brilliant performances and astounding climax.",10/10,Drishyam 2

Other people action accept ajay devgan is not upto mark specially we are expecting from akshay khanna. I the conclusion during pendemic the indian society explore the story and acting skill on ott and now we expect same acting and drama from the indian .

As everyone knows the standard of Bollywood is too low but then I found out that this movie is a remake of a south movie. That's how finally Bollywood got a good script. I am yet to watch that south movie but it's rating shows that it is really nice. Everyone who likes this movie should watch that one too.as we should appreciate that original piece of work.This movie I liked it a lot as finally after so many years saw something special in Bollywood as the Bollywood movies standard going down with no good script and acting level because the nepotism doing their role.Must watch movie with so much thrill and a really nice story.,8/10,Drishyam 2
snehab,15 January 2023,Could have been less than 2.5 hrs film,"The build up for the entire movie was a bit much, especially in the first half of the movie. For a thriller, it did not really kept me hooked as there were a lot of parts which i felt was not needed like the girl facing epilepsy and having nightmares around it and the IPS visiting their place for a ""friendly"" visit. People are saying that the movie is an exact copy-paste from the original, so the discussion on creative writing is not really needed here. The movie can be watched once if you have the time to, but not watching it wont really make any difference. And thats why a 6 by 10 rating overall! :)

sagaremo,18 November 2022,Gripping Murder Mystery,"I am not sure if they had to follow the same base of the story line of the original (which I haven't watched) but I felt the story could have been mixed more with spices on the second half.First half was slow yet got me hooked but the second part went away so fast. It could have been made more better if the climax was ploted more in depth rather than only touching the baseline. Tabbu's role in it was not much bold than it was potrayed in first part but yet the story itself explains how wounded she has become with passing time.Although this will be the massive hit for the mass plus the presence of same faces after years also revived the memory. Akshay's character was so much refined and it was great watching him in action.

parthmore-75819,8 January 2023,Disappointing to say the least,"I went into this movie with high hopes, having seen the original and also the prequel. Sad to say, I was really disappointed with the film. It starts off strong, and then eventually just tapers off nowhere. The writing is flimsy, and the acting is hammy. As a lifelong ardent Ajay Devgn fan, I was really expecting a lot from this film. Ajay brings his own signature swag along for the ride, but it is difficult to save this sinking ship and by the time Akshaye Khanna arrives, it really is too late. The supporting cast is okay-ish at best, and do what they can to keep the bloated script from falling apart. Overall, not a great watch.

And keeping the character of Laxmikant Gaitonde played by Kamlesh Sawant was brilliant, which the original Film didn't keep. Ajay Devgan has given a good performance. Siddharth Bodke has made a defference. The BGM is beautiful. The use of Goa is done para excellence. Do see it to know how a remake should be made.

harryraj-39503,20 November 2022,Awesome Movie,"Awesome movie once again....but i Like first one more than this part, because first part was amazing from start to end but in 2nd part, it seems that all focus was given to the end of the movie...and end of this movie is really good üëå
Acting wise...1. Akshey khanna's acting was not much impressive. 2. There was unnecessarily extra fear were given by mother and her two daughters(i don't know these three actress name) that looked some over acting type... 3. Tabbu ma'am role is not much in this part. 4. Ajay sir was superb like always, his acting always look so real and it should be after all he is the only main role of this movie.. üëç

goluavinashsharma,24 November 2022,I love the movie,"Excellent Sequel ,Outstanding edge of the seat thriller , poora paisa vasool 5 Star. Firstly Big big big salute to Jeetu Joseph for this masterpiece original story for Drishyam 2 . Vijay Salgaonkar returns in the 2nd installment standing strong to save his family yet again , the film is shot in Goa , there are beautiful locales , the thrill factor drives the film , the narration & screenplay just flows organically and you just get engaged & enjoy the whole story telling ,such crisp is the screenplay . The twist in the 2nd half is commendable & the Climax thrill just blows your mind , it is soo brilliant and you just feel like clapping at the scenes , kudos to the director for such beautiful direction .. BGM is topnotch , cinematography is lovely , editing has been spot on .The amazing cast of Drishyam 1 is retained & to add to this we have absolutely wonderful actors i.e Akshaye Khanna as the new IG & Saurabh Shukla as the writer , both have aced their roles which ease and it was an absolute delight to watch them . Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar delivers blast of a performance , Kamlesh Savant as Gaitonde is another highlight in the film . Tabu has got very less screen space in this instalment . All and all this film is an excellent sequel which you shouldnt miss in the cinemas, its a wonderful film after a long time that you will never regret watching . Just go for it.",10/10,Drishyam 2
johnmessey,29 November 2022,Time & money waste,"Why Bollywood is copying South's story rather creating ther own concept. Amazon Prime has the original Drishyam 1&2 (South movie) part available. Nothing new in this just the star cast so people can come and spend money for ther stardom. Bloody time and money waste. I feel sorry for those who are appreciating the director for this remake movie. For God's sake understand the difference between original and remake it has nothing new. Although the direction was good but it's also copied from them. I am sure the director will work hard next time to bring his own concept to the world not from some South movies.

Perfect 2nd part for audience
Makers keep the Banrd name of DRISHYAM

Ajay Devgan's eyes can act better then many more Bollywood heros. This movie will told you that. An action Hero proved Himself again that he can acting in any kind of role. If its 3rd part announced i will not be surprised for that becouse writers makes thag faith. Akshay Khaana's acting was fantastic. His entry will fall you in tensionWriters wrote the stories very cleverly and keep the sususpences. Hope everyone will enjoy the movie.THANK YOU.

abhishekqw,8 January 2023,Could have been better,"The cast is amazing. It's always a treat to see Tabu in a grey light, wanted to see more of Akshay Khanna to. Also, Shriya Saran's character deserves justice cause we all know she is so much more than the character she played in the movie. The plot is pretty cool, but the execution is very bland, the first half of the film was so boring that I was zoned out and yawning throughout, and the second half was no good either I think I only enjoyed the last few 20 minutes of the film. The background music sort of overshadowed the thrill and the suspense, it was so loud that it made it hard to focus on what was actually happening. Still don't skip it if you get a chance to watch it.

choosey_movie,18 November 2022,An actual thriller,"This is how a movie should be. Everything needs to make sense n justify y it's being done. The gradual build up that eventually adds up is finely done. The way of directing n some other elements like color theme n lighting being different from the original movie has added an extra depth n uniqueness to the movie . The cast especially ajay and akshaye have done a phenomenal job while giving justice to their roles. The script is a great example to all the movies about how equally great a sequel cab be.On a whole a very phenomenal ride n totally enjoyable. A solid 10. A perfect sequel .

abdulkareemnaikwadi,21 November 2022,Awesome,"Ajay Devgn's Drishyam, released in 2015, was simply superb which was an official remake of Malayalam film Drishyam starring Mohanlal thanks to its thundering climax and electrifying screenplay.The sequel, Drishyam 2, which releases today takes the story forward when the IG (played by Akshaye Khanna ) re-opens the case which led to the disappearance of son of Meera (Tabu), leading the trail back to Vijay Salgaonkar and his family.While the first film was directed by late Nishikant Kamat, Abhishek Pathak returns to the director's chair with slow-burn and yet engaging story written brilliantly by Jeetu Joseph with twist and turns enough to keep you at bay. Drishyam 2 starts off on a slow note but gathers the steam towards the second half. The series of events infuses life to the film and will keep you guessing with what-will-happen-next scenes. Of course, the editing could have better reducing the duration of the film, especially in the first half.It is the last one hour of the film which makes it an interesting watch thanks to the outstanding climax. The only actor who could match to the calibre of Mohanlal is Ajay Devgn . The actor expresses adequately through his eyes and gives a stunning performance. Akshaye Khanna is just turning out to be fabulous with each and every role he plays and this one is definitely on the radar. Tabu and Shriya Saran's character could have been better written.So, overall, Drishyam2 is worthy sequel to 2015 s Drishyam which should be applauded for its skillful writing, brilliant performances and astounding climax.",10/10,Drishyam 2

Must watch for those who haven't watched the original.The new addition, Akshaye Khanna, elevated the film with his classy screen presence. He's the greatest asset of this film.Ajaydevgn did well to underplay his part.Tabu & Gaitonde - ferociousshriya & ishi dutta added depth by showing their vulnerability.1 star less because I had an issue with the screenplay of convenience (back when I watched the Malayalam version as well) & it still stands.But that doesn't matter much coz it struck a chord with the masses.",9/10,Drishyam 2

srimantdas-24387,14 January 2023,Utter waste of time if you watched the Malayalam original one,"I watched this on OTT after one of my friend, who is ardent Ajay Devgan fan, suggested that Bollywood did something different than the Original. But to my utter disappointment it's a hopeless copy paste with some little cosmetic changes. Like when u copy someone else's writing but just change the sentences/ prepositions but everything else in the content remains same. There is no significant change in story/ climax or anything else. Strictly DON'T watch if u watched the original and liked it.Bollywood is the most useless movie industry and nonetheless other regional movies are creating their own charm. It would be better if Bollywood stop making hopeless remakes and make something original.

amrikchakrabortysdt,13 January 2023,Could have been better.,"I felt the script could have been so much better and also didn't like how it was shot; after 130 minutes, when the business associate speaks, you're basically piecing together what happened seven years ago with practically no context. The correct question is, ""What exactly is happening in this movie?"" Our main character wants to make a movie, and another family wants their kid back, but after 100 minutes, nobody who hasn't seen the original movie knows anything about it. In the opening credits, there is a brief flashback, but there is no narrator or story with words on the screen to try and catch you up.Found some plotholes too. This movie might have been better with a simple explanation in the flashback at the beginning.

Vijay and his family are moving on with their lives until the case is reopened by the IG ( Akshaye Khanna ). What follows is a cat and mouse game. Ajay Devgn and Akshaye Khanna are spot on with their performances. Tabu has little impact while Shriya Saran, Rajat Kapoor, Ishita Dutta and Saurabh Shukla were okay. The reintroduction of Gaitonde was useless regarding that he has little impact to the story. Certain scenes have been changed to make the story more original. The introduction scene of the IG was far better than the malayalam version. Though the court scene was ruined. The interrogation scene feels exaggerated. Certain scene also felt quite rushed.

I was expecting a decent fantasy mystery movie. But after a particular scene, the movie shifted its pivot to a different issue and it stayed there till the end. It was frustratingly boring in the second half and it killed all the interest I had watching the first few minutes of the movie. Then, the movie slowly decayed into the same old stuff we have seen 100 times before. Costumes are different, setting is different but core stuff is the same.The last few minutes were good from a performance point of view, but it felt like pointless as at that point, the movie became something else and it didn't matter to the overall outcome of the movie.Animations and VFX were good but could have been better.

You know what I mean by that, same old story bad guy, a good guy, villagers and bad guy trying to get something for own and good guy stops it. Same old same old, one hero beating all the bad guys and so on. And ofcourse a bit of lovestory spice and family member being murdered kind of usual things.Such a disappointment.

eszterokelemen,6 January 2023,Did we watch the same movie?,"Did we really watch the same movie?The cinematography itself of this movie is absolutely fantastic, really captivating - well done for the cameramen and recording producer. But that's about the positives I can say.This movie can't decide what it wants to be and what story it wants to tell. Storyline is going left and right, not really coherent or making any sense. What is the message?For me the message was that you can be a horrible human being in the name of tradition/culture and you can get away with abusive behaviour, destroying the environment, killing wild and endangered animals, excessive drinking and objectifying women.The main character who is supposedly this ""legend"" is about, and who is titled a ""hero"" is having anger issues, physically abusive, has a drinking and weed problem, exploits nature for his own agenda/benefit oh and has a raging fit when he doesn't win.At the beginning of this movie I thought it had great potential, and that it will make you think about the fragile balance of living with nature. Well it didn't.The environmental officer who is very reasonably tried to protect the jungle was (almost) portrayed as the ""bad guy"".It also had many many clich√©s that you seen in thousands of Indian movies. Seriously why the villan always look exactly the same? I am sure we all knew who is going to be the villain from the first time they showed him to us.In conclusion I would have loved this movie, if the story is at least coherent and that it had some positive message. But unfortunately, that wasn't the case.Also I kinda feel like the positive comments here are the same and they might have been paid to say it was a good movie?Hard pass for me.",2/10,Kantara

radiantfractal,16 November 2022,Kantara - Much ado about nothing.,"A month ago, without having watched it, I'd been asking people to watch Kantara in theater. To practice what I preached, I finally myself watched it in theater today. Average, at best.This is what the movie was:1. A very interesting but rushed beginning introducing us to the dev. We wish to see it more but the maker was in a hurry to get to the boring part.2. A 45 year old actor plays a 25 year old guy.3. Daaru, beedi, gaanja.4. Cruelty on animals.5. Cutting and damaging of forests.6. Objectification of women.7. Violence against forest-officials doing their job.8. Justifying everything in a very naxalite way.9. Points 3 to 8 repeated several times till we get to the climax.10. A battle between the villagers and the villain's men in the climax. The villain literally sits on a chair in the middle of the battle and is unscathed.11. After the village is almost razed down and the hero almost killed, he gets possessed by the dev and kills the villain. We want to see more of the dev but the movie ends there. The maker was reluctant showing the interesting bit.You walk out of the theater wondering what was so great about the movie.",5/10,Kantara
samxxxul,2 October 2022,Transcendent: There are movies and then there is Kantara,"Absolutely bonkers, wild and a movie worth for a discussion. This film impresses with its variety of forms and feelings - there is a whole bunch of emotions. Rishab Shetty has the ability to cater his films to moviegoers of all class and successfully crossed that divide between indie and mainstream. Even his production 'Pedro' and which is doing wonders in the festival circuit endows his ability to strike a balance. Likewise with Rakshit Shetty who has backed so many indie films including the recent Sakutumba Sametha (2022).Coming to Kantara, this film has so many layers of complexity and it's amazing Rishab expresses a lot while keeping it grounded, rooted and minimalistic. With unending sound of the biosphere set in Tulunadu as a conjunction between ecology, greed of man, civilization and everything in between sums up the tone of the film. I loved the idea of the flashback and voiceover to set things going from the start. On the other hand, this is a proper commercial film so expect all the genre troupes, elevations, guy falling head over heels in love and a story done to death. But Rishab stands out as he chooses this inalienable closeness of mother earth and man, adds the main ingredient, i.e. Is ENTERTAINMENT!Even Shiva as the rebel concept was conveyed so well, the face-off that involves internal and external conflicts will immerse you. His character is grey and not without its downsides as he lives in two worlds at the same time. The first is the world of flesh and bone, and the second is the divine, which is his true calling to carry the legacy of his father. The realization is pretty good, when he gets nightmares for the wrongdoings, he is led to this mysterious place in the forest, like a portal. It happens in the pre-climax after the brilliant ""i am cleansed,"" scene, very short and doesn't go into full details of the transformation. The gloomy atmosphere in the film occupies a central niche, besides, the tone of that forest, it also contributes to the overall outcome of the film.The visuals are ideally combined with subplots and the authenticity to mix the culture of Kambla and Bhootha Kola is not an overkill. It is picturized so well as the climax moments densely settles in memory for quite a long time and it will be the same for other viewers too.The main thing here is that the spirit of Rishab Shetty to keep it authentic right from music, staging, actors and ending with costumes. It is really tough that he will have another big film comparable to Kantara in his career. To put it simply and briefly, I am delighted with the viewing. Enjoyed every minute from start to finish. A community watch, a spectacle made for only celluloid experience. I know when this will be out on OTT so called shallow cinephhiles, purists, Xenolingohassens will find it cringe and problematic. I am still going with 10/10 sure I'm obviously biased, the making, production value soothed the drought of content driven commercial films lacking in kannada industry. Mark my words, this will be remembered by those who have experienced it only on the bring screen even after decades.",10/10,Kantara
shyamtheju,2 October 2022,Still not able to come out of the Kantara World....!!!,"No words to explain.... Outstanding Cinema. All departments hardwork shows in the screen. Aravind Kashyap cinematography is next level. BGM and Song from Ajaneesh gives goosebumps. The Director and Actor Rishabh Shetty is fire. Saptami Gowda did excellent and romantic part is very raw and goes with the story well. Kishore and Achyuth Sir perfect casting and brought justice to the role. Subtle comedy by Shiva and Gang keeps the story moving. The last climax is the must watch theatre experience and a divine moment. Proud film from Kannada industry and deeply rooted cultural but commercial entertainer. Finally thanks for Hombale Films to backing this project.

coolguyajit,29 October 2022,Whats the fuss about!,"I seriously dont undertsand all the hooplah around it. Yes, the God-messenger thing is kind of novel but everything else is what we have been seeing in Indian movies for past several decades, the main storyline being the rich oppressing the poor or say the upper class oppressing the lower. Acting is loud, so is the background, it felt more like noise than background score. Climax is good, everything else is bore. I didnt find anything worth praising, there arent any special moments or dialogues either. I found it nothing but loud, too loud. Filled with overacting characters. I repent watching it.

madhujith,12 October 2022,"Went in for the hype, came out with GOOSEBUMPS","After hearing so much about this movie, went in even without watching the trailer, but from the very beginning of the movie, boy was I glued to the screen!Loved the way the complex character of Shiva was portrayed.... The way he is constantly running away from his destiny and taking refuge in the 'material luxuries' (aka. Drink, waste away time etc.).The movie, do subtly and brilliantly captures the exploration of innocence by the rich and powerful! The different paths to the same end (DRFO and Shiva), the complexity and diversity of culture.... Just WOW!When the climax approached, I was left speechless! Had tears in my eyes and had my hands folded(completely unknowningly). I drive back with my wife after a late night show here in Australia and was a good 45 min drive and we both didn't utter a word!I was still in a state of trance the whole of next day!!!If this doesn't deserve an Oscar....

SoumikBanerjee25,27 November 2022,I guess I will fall into the minority this time,"I am extremely sorry to say this, but Kantara might be one of, if not the most overhyped release in recent times. After scouring through an unusually high amount of positive reviews coming from ordinary viewers and professional critics alike who by the way sang only praises for this feature, I was genuinely curious, it was their assessments that led me to believe that I was going to witness something astonishing, otherworldly, something that goes beyond normalcy.Alas! My experience with the movie came to be extensively different.With all due respect to the creators as well as all those people who have had their fair share of fun and entertainment; I find this effort to be rather average. If I put its visceral presentation and the brilliant performance delivered by none other than Rishab Shetty on one side; there's barely anything that caught my interest.The story is generic, the characterizations lack a certain insightfulness (barring Shiva) and on top of all, the screenplay here is unnecessarily elongated which not only made things more complicated but it also made me relish its intricacies far less than I expected.",5/10,Kantara
bharathshetty,2 October 2022,Please research Dakshina Kannada and Udupi region Bhoota Aradhane traditions before watching this movie!,"It's an amazing movie showcasing the regional culture of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi region of Karnataka.I am from this region and am familiar with the tradition of Bhoota Aradhana. This may seem superstitious and even scary initially, but it's okay, believe me, even I felt or used to feel the same. My humble request to the audience who are not familiar with this tradition, is that you to do a small research into 'Bhoota Kola' , 'Panjurli' and 'Guliga' daivas...this would make your experience and understanding this movie more enjoyable!.This movie is a masterpiece trying to bring out the hidden, often misunderstood traditions into the mainstream. This is the reality, who many people in our country are not aware and it's absolutely okay. Such movies are helpful to make us all understand that India is a land of such a diversity and yet so beautiful!",10/10,Kantara

I'm not a Bollywood fan & i hate Varun Dhawan because of his over acting but i liked Bhediya much more than Kantara.. I'm not saying Kantara is bad but both movie shares the same message to protect Nature.. if actually want to see defference 1st watch Kantara then Bhediya you'll feel the difference yourself.. Bhediya is good humourous & fun you'll not get bored.. i don't know why Bhediya is suppressed.. & Katara is getting over hyped..

akhil027,22 October 2022,Rishab Shetty shines in this pretty solid and slightly overhyped movie.,"The opening and ending scene of Kantara is nothing like you've seen before. The way they wrote the mythological background was so good. But those are limited to the opening scene and climax. What happens in between is the overtold story of the rough hero who gets into trouble for his locality, his love interest and the conflict in the name of their place.I can't believe they still write characters like Sreevalli and Leela. In the very first scene in which Leela is introduced, the hero straight up physically assaults her. There are other ways to write a romance, you know? No matter how progressed these movies become. They just can't get the female characters right.The screenplay, direction cinematography, stunts, artwork and acting are pretty great. The screaming could've been dialed down a bit. The repeated screams might give you a headache. Rishab Shetty's performance in the climax is hands down one of the finest work I've ever seen in a Kannada movie. He handled something that could've gone very wrong really well.It's theater material. Each person is different. This review is my opinion. Watch it in theaters and decide for yourself. Movies like these are made for theatres.",7/10,Kantara
rohandskmn,1 October 2022,Masterpiece,"Rarely does a movie like this come out which makes you feel you have been transported into another world. As a tuluva this made me so proud. More than anything else I want to thank Rishab Shetty for bringing out and showing our motherland and its rich culture to the entire world.Coming to the movie part, it was nothing less than perfect. The acting, the story telling, the cinematography etc was class apart <3
Rishab shettre ereg dever edde malpad. Keep growing and keep delivering such master pieces throughout your life. This movie should receive National award and Rishab Anna should also receive National award for his brilliant acting.

movie_goer82,16 December 2022,"Hype won, Indian audience got fooled","Year 2022 sums up that Indian viewer have lost the taste of good cinema by excessive usage of misleading content on their smartphone, Whatsapp and their TV news.A narrative can sway away the average Indian and they can ignore good films like Laal Singh Chaddha or Sardar Udham while average films like Kashmir Files or Kantara become smash hits.This film had nothing to cheer about. Only last 10 minutes had something which can be appreciated. Vikrant Rona was better than this and Whoever is comparing this with masterpiece like Tumbbad are the manipulated individuals who think Whatsapp forwards or inflated rating system are the real source of information while they decide what to watch or believe.

nazgulz,1 November 2022,Most overrated THING I've watched till now!!,"I was expecting something like Tumbbad after reading synopsis/summary on IMDB and it's rated 9.2 so I thought it should be mythological like Bahubali or Tumbbad.Whole movie is based on wild boars, in most of the film, main character is hunting them. In the name of 'mythology', main character dreams about a boar like every 30 minute for 10 seconds, that's it.In my opinions it is a typical South Indian movie with mild references to Hindu mythology.The ratings are result from bombardment of 10 rating by the people who are influenced by the culture shown in movie, not by story itself. I have been watching movies based on ratings and reviews on IMDB since 2008 and it has been quite helpful. Now a days you can't trust IMDB rating because now new movies are often full of fake ratings like this one. Its should be rated not more than 7.5/10 according to the story.Hope, my review helps! Wrote this after many years because I wanted to point out this trend.",2/10,Kantara

Why does this movie hold such a high rating on imdb, people are going nuts over this movie , I think just to boycott Bollywood people are high rating such kind of movies .

To be honest, I got so much excited for the movie that I had a lot of expectations for the movie. After watching the movie, I can conclude that the movie was highly overrated. There was nothing new in the movie. It had all the same elements as old South Indian movies. I don't know why people were so much excited for the movie. The story was simple with little bit new elements and nothing else was special in the movie.Overall, it was a average movie and too overrated. I was literally disappointed.

There doesn't seem to be any reason for unnecessary shouting in the entire movie, it annoys you and mainly it doesn't leave any impact. The movie is purely being driven by fan followers, who just want to prove this as a masterpiece. This clearly is not a masterpiece, nowhere even near to it. The characters in the movie doesn't seem to come out clearly, the male lead, female lead, the forest guard, the landlord, all of them doesn't seem to have clearly defined characters. If the unknown power could kill someone on court footsteps then why the landlord wasn't killed the same way? It just doesn't seem to make any sense.

indianature,28 November 2022,Over Hyped,"I watched Kantara (orig. Kannada w/Eng. Subs.) on Prime Video with great expectations given the almost 9/10 imdb rating and so much hype and publicity. The film was overall a big let down and one wonders about the rating system!The Good Parts:The last segment perhaps 45mn, was brilliant where the protagonist Shiva (Rishab Shetty) becomes the Bhoota Kola ritual performer going into a superbly enacted trance.The prologue is also well filmed introducing the background to the plot, where the King of old gives his vast land and forests to the original Adivasi forest dwellers in return for experiencing the divine through the Bhoota Kola ritual; later generations of the Zamindar are shown going to court to get back the land but die at the footsteps as per the curse.The Bhoota Kola shamanic traditions of the region (Tuluvanadu) are well depicted as is the local Kambala harvest festival. This indeed has created interest in a large section of the public to learn more about such ancient rituals which are practised in several forms in old communities world wide as in India.The evils of casteism are well depicted where the ""upper caste"" landlord to look good invites the so called ""lower caste"" villagers to his home but once they leave, the house is ritually cleansed :-(((Conflicts between the forest department and the original forest dwellers which is also a present day issue in many forested parts of India, was also quite well depicted.The music is quite good. Apparently the music of the chart busting Varaha Roopam song is changed in OTT from the cinema version due to a court order vis a vis the plagiarism charge by the band Thaikkudam Bridge for their original song Navarasam. Hombale Films who admit to being ""inspired"" by Navarasam, could easily have settled this issue amicably with T. Bridge! I was also reminded by one of the other songs, of something vaguely from Bollywood. Not to mention certain scenes reminded me of scenes from the recent Telugu blockbuster film Pushpa.The Mediocre Parts:The overall narration between the introduction and the finale which was the core length of the film, did not hold the interest. Some frames were actually boring and quite fast forwardable.There were far too many scenes of violence, albeit slickly choreographed, undoubtedly will appeal to action lovers.Though there were some humorous dialogues, the absence of correct comedic timing spoilt the punchline.Excessive frames of felling the forest as a mode of protest gives a very wrong message to an impressionable public.Summary: Overhyped film. A shorter length, tighter narration and less of the action / violence would have made Kantara a much better production. Anyway, the massive box office profits have surely made the producers very happy !",2/10,Kantara
aabhat2000,6 December 2022,Fuss over nothing,"I read all the rave reviews, watched the movie with a lot of interest and attention. Dragged myself through 1:30 hours of the movie, with the eternal hope that it would become interesting at some point in time. And yet, even after watching the ending I failed to understand why all the fuss about this movie and acclaimed reviews. This one is a total dud for me.The movie keeps rambling through sequences which do not have link towards next and could have been totally removed without affecting the story. The story does not lead anywhere at all. Just typical macho image of a south Indian hero is on display throughout the movie. No substance.

bloodymexycool,27 November 2022,Typical overdramatic movie with a great song and visuals in the end,"To begin with the movie is pretty typical and boring. The scenes are overdramatised and the movie seems to be extremely overhyped. The exception being the ending song which is amazing but I have found out this was copied from a song navarasam by Thaikkudam Bridge. Without this song the movie is just ""mehh"".Most of the acting atleast for me is overdramatic.. it's mostly overreaction to situations.. and the situation being a typical land mafia vs local tribals cause which just ends abruptly. The culture depicted in the movie is the USP it again seems to be heavily copied or inspired from the navarasam plot and without this song the movie has not meaning at all. 10/10 for the song.. 5/10 for rest of the movie. But finding out that it's copied and production house not giving any credit to the original creators and victim of this daylight robbery, I would put down some points and say that this movie doesn't deserve to be called a win.

That was too immature.I still cant find a reason for these extra hype about the movie. It is way below average and nothing to praise about.

navendu_krishnan,2 October 2022,What a creation !,"Happened to Watch Kantara (Forest), in a jampacked houseful show. Weekend was a red zone for this movie beating PS1, and Vikram Vedha in Bangalore. I had to travel 16 KM to HSR Thirumala. But all efforts were worth !Kantara is absolutely breath taking, I some how liked more than KGF. Its a next venture of Homable films after KGF chapter 2Kantara is an epitome of how Rishab Shetty as an Actor, DIrector and Writer finds his place is the same film. I always admired Rishab shetty for his excellent story creation and direction, From Kirik Party, Kasargodu Shaale and as an Actor in many.Starting with the story, Kantara is a fight between good and evil, sometimes the god, sometimes the people of the forest. Eventually at the end, the god wins always, it is crafted with a touch of Boota Kola a worship from Tulu nadu - Malanadu and Northern Kerala. It resembles the Theyyam art as well. Just like the demographic picturization , kantara shot in Dakshin Karnataka forest area, the crew made an intense research on Art, Music and folklore in Kundapura to all the way Kasargod. Hence the location, Cinematography, Art all were treat for the eye.Acting cannot be ruled out, Rishab as a main lead was excellent, Kishore did his career best role. Achyuth Kumar, Pramod Shetty, Swaraj Shetty - all were perfect cast.Another best thing about this movie is the music , its a mixture of folklore - jaanapada a form of folk song , ajaneesh loknath is the music director. Some of the songs will give us the goosebumps.In all words, Kantara is a story of Uprising of a Forest against its exploiters. The movie, especially the climax is an Adrenaline Rush !Well made! 9/10.",9/10,Kantara
priyagowda-28199,2 October 2022,It will remain as a masterpiece in KFI,"What a masterpiece created by Rishabh Shetty üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª, his character as Shiva will remain in everyone's heart whoever watches the movie. The story line, screenplay, cinematography omg it's all mind-blowing. Rishabh the mastermind behind this movie is proving again and again that he can create magic onscreen, his entry by kambala scene was on fire. Each and every character in the movie has taken the movie to the next level, can't choose one to praise them. But Kishore as DRFO and Acchyuth Kumar as landlord are terrific to watch. Ajaneesh's music is treat to watch, his BGMs will make you to sit at the edge of your seat.

shruthisathya,26 November 2022,"SAME OLD MASALA WITH THE USUAL INGREDIENTS (with added ""FEAR IN GOD"")","I would have given a four stars to this moive. But giving 1 star to balance out all the fake hype. Except for the first and the last scenes there is nothing in this movie. Mr. Rishab's acting on the climax for the last five minutes is awesome. With that said, there is no logic in the screen play or the story development. Romance (or whatever that's been portrayed as romance) is disgusting. The so called comedy is unbearable, un-laughable, old with adult contents. Rishab shetty certainly followed a clever formula, by making the audience excited right before the end. All most everyone felt possessed, and gave out rave reviews upon exiting, which was the main reason for this success. Or they were scared thinking that the ""God"" would punish them if they don't praise him...lol.... :D.

mugen-is-here,26 November 2022,"A few very serious questions to all kannadigas, outsiders and people in other states","In the movie we have shown a hero that is very unnatural. Before you express your love for this character and story, what will you say for these things?1) You will respect a hero only if he wins in competitions? And not just 1. All.This hero always wins every game. Why?Is it bad to lose in games? What is wrong in showing that a hero can lose as well?A mature man accepts defeat and tries again. A mature man doesn't feel bad when defeated. He just tries a different way.The more you give 10 stars to animal heroes, the more they will appear in the movies.2) What do you feel about respect for women? Hero constantly harasses the woman and even pinches her. She's shown as nothing more than a sex object.I've never seen a single kannadiga or outsider doing this to a woman. Then why are we showing such cheap characters?All the locals who love this movie. Do you not care how your women are treated? Imagine if your daughter, sister, mother, cousin were pinched on her waist like this. If you won't like that then why are you giving this movie a 10 stars?3) Entire movie hero is shouting ""woohaaa, woohaaa"". Does that show a mature man or an animal man?Everyone is saying this movie shows Karnataka culture. How many men have you seen in Karnataka who go around jumping like monkeys and fighting like goons the entire day?Imagine Bengaluru if all men were wild like this. Imagine any Karnataka village if men were wild like this. Will it look like civilized place or like caveman days?STOP encouraging gundas in the movie. STOP giving 10 star for animal characters. üôèüôè4) You will respect a hero only if he wins every fight, is it? In this movie the hero fights endlessly.He has a disagreement with the police officer. Punch. Disagreement with another villager. Direct punch. Doesn't win the award due to politics. Punch.What nonsense is this?Conclusion:Does this movie truly show Karnataka values? üôèüôèPlz have some self-respect if you are in Karnataka. Show the world that Karnataka culture is better than these trash characters and this trash storyline.Show maturity. Not animalism. üôèüôè",1/10,Kantara
barkhaagarwalla,17 December 2022,Did I watch the same film that everyone is talking about ?,"Watched this with a lot of expectations due to good reviews from friends and the hype online but ..... did I just watch a different film ? Cause to me it was just an average film. The story was pretty average, cliched (this plot has been heavily repeated throughout the history of Indian cinema) and I got so bored after 1.5 hrs into the film that I had to stop. I kept waiting all this time for the story to pick up and for the film to get better and engaging but it never did. The protagonist is someone I couldn't root for at all. I sat down again later to complete the film in the hope to understand the hype. The cinematography and setup in some scenes is very brilliant specially those showing the ancient ritualistic practices involving the demi God and the Kola dance but that's about it. Rishabh Shetty performed great in the last 15 mins and the background score in the climax was good as well but nothing else was special, gripping or out of the ordinary for the rest 2.10 hrs of the film. I am really and heavily confused about all the hype. There are much better films out there which never received the recognition they deserved. Kantara for me was only a one time watch and I could have easily given it a pass.",5/10,Kantara
paragshrijoshi,28 October 2022,Good but Overhyped,"Had this movie released a few years back when Bollywood was still at the top and southern cinema hasn't crossed its regional boundaries, it would have been a unbaised appreciation of this movie.I found the movie as a genuine attempt but calling it the greatest ever made in India is just foolishness.Rishabh Shetty owns the movie as the performer, writer and director. Cinematography and music too elevates the movie experience manifolds. The core story is deep yet predictable. The climax (hyped again) has nothing new to offer as the protogonist's character behaves like a bahubali throughout the film which shouldn't have been done.

mailminie,21 December 2022,Much ado about nothing!!,"This is no Tumbad. The first few minutes are promising and one starts expecting an allegory of man-nature conflict. But then the movie meanders into stuff we have seen in many recent movies - testosterone raging machismo, bawdy humour, often getting sexist, needless song and dance, over the top emotions and action. The journey and the growth curve of the characters lack conviction. In the final 15-20 mins, the movie returns to its original theme, but just about. My rating is for the few minutes in the beginning and the end, Rishabh Shetty's acting in the final moments. It could have been at least an hour shorter.

stylegamer,25 November 2022,"based on mythology of Sudalai Madan ....Average but not worth much of the hype,,,,","Firstly i watched the Tamil dubbed version . Having come from Tamil films , there was not much of a story except the usual mainstream ( one line story : A rich man tried to oppress the poor and the fight for land rights), no script, no meaningful dialogue delivery. And the main part, culture ; They failed to show the richness of culture maybe only except in small parts. The main positive aspect about this film are the good visuals and the authentic rural setting.So many people will be offended but the truth is, movie is just on the the average. However is nothing special in this film which we never saw in Tamil Hindi or Telegu films which at most times have much fleshed put e story lines. Its hard to understand what the fuss is about regarding this film. For most part of the film , the politics between different groups of people regarding the aquisition of the land is portrayed. However it would have been much better if the major parts of the film concentrated on the greatness of and mystique of the protector deity.The acting performances are very typical of Kannada films . The first half a dragging storyline and comedy with quirky one-liners of cheap grade films in the 1990s. The fight scenes are not inspiring except for the final scene where it feels slightly better.. It has some decent music and cinemamatography that is not unlike other films in Tamil or Telegu. And thats about as much positive as u can get . Otherwise it is a an average film with as compared with other regional films.",6/10,Kantara
prolead,30 November 2022,From the frying pan into the fire,"So, let me clear this up:The entire premise of the film is based on the land that was offered to the villagers in exchange for the landlords' peace and prosperity, which was guaranteed by the ""Gods.""To make matters worse, the government (forest department) wants to claim this land now and turn it into a reserve forest.The villagers are currently fighting for their land and are caught between a frying pan (landlords) and a fire (Govt).Finally, the land is under the control of the government rather than the landlords, and the villagers are pleased?In my opinion, the villagers were forced to give up their land to the government rather than the landlords, and they still lost. Not to mention the lost lives, property destruction, and hardship.I'm not sure what was accomplished!",5/10,Kantara
valfrae,21 December 2022,almost entrancing,"The movie was great. Although the plot was predictable, and I could see what was gonna happen from miles away, the topic was interesting. Rishab Shetty did a brilliant job as Panjurli Daiva and Guliga Daiva. For the scale and budget it was made in, it's truly remarkable how they pulled it off.However, in a religious film like this, where Shiva was shown as a special child of god, almost as if he was the ""chosen one"", to show Shiva pinching bellies and harassing women, and in one scene, continuing to making out with her when she said 'no' was just so disgusting to see. Then he later went on to dance in the Bhoota Kolas.

HollyGolightly123,28 November 2022,Kantara is a waste of time!,"8.9/10?!! What a joke!I watched the dubbed version so it might have lost in translation. It is a predictable plot which has influences of Karnan, Rangastalam and Puspha.The story revolves around Shiva, a wayward with haunting PTSD and acts creepy when pursuing his lady love. The villagers keep exploiting the forest resources for their own greed. I almost felt sorry for police officer working among these unsavory characters. Hindu symbolism is very evident but some scenes felt overdone and others borderline comedic. The music was forgettable, action was mediocre and acting was sub par.Not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, a below average film in my view.

Movie has excellent shots and like any other south movies , larger than life action. The story is linear , but is presented in grand way.The lead character , Shiva is a muscular and childish by behavior , which i loved. But once again , some shots are spectacular , like when he smoke beside iron smith in the end.Within budget it does a great job.

The world created in this movie is truly magnificent. Rishab Shetty my goodness has delivered a performance that is beyond anyones expectation. This will remain as a gem in the South Indian cinema. Mostly importantly a proud Kannada movie that will stand out for many years to come. This will be a stepping stone to many more movies to come in the next generation. There's not a single scene that makes you feel bored and this is captivating stuff. I hope they don't make another part and ruin this gem. Let it remain as single movie.

Movie_buff_shree,27 November 2022,A divine first 10 minutes & last 10 minutes,"Movie deserves an 8+ but anything beyond 9 is very much unnecessary. Balancing the IMDb score by giving it a 1. The first 10 minutes & the last 10 minutes is where the movie deserves an applause. The rest of the movie is quite normal, infact there is plenty of commercial elements.The song ""Varaha Roopam"" is unforgettable and it's a shame that the music director failed to acknowledge that it's inspired from the song ""Navarasam"" by Thaikudam Bridge. I literally had goosebumps in the first 10 minutes & the last 10 minutes. Rishabh Shetty was phenomenal is the climax scenes. Kishore as usual did a great job. The OTT version is a disappointment as the song Varaha Roopam is removed & edited with a newer one which is a waste. Yes, bring back the original Varaha Roopam.

I am big fan of director, but this actor and director is deadly combination....lastly the mysticism is eye throbbing.

abhilash7,30 October 2022,One of the worse movies,After seeing all these ten star reviews and all the hype I went to watch this in theater. As the movie progressed I kept waiting for something big to happen and thought all the characterization was being developed for some major twist. Intermission came and still nothing major. By the time movie ended I was left very disappointed and no clue how this movie has a very high 9.2 rating at all and all these glowing reviews. Even final fight sequence is cut short and we do not get to see the final justice for the villain on screen to give any satisfaction. The only positive is Rishab Shetty did great acting for the climax in the last 5 minutes but it is not worth watching this long movie for. Definitely a big disappointment.,1/10,Kantara
humairaf-54193,3 December 2022,Terrible movie,"The direction of the entire movie was pretty bad. The story line was everywhere, no sense for non-Kannada audience. The music was a nuisance in the whole movie. The movie was loud and over dramatic to watch. It is definitely not a family movie and can't be watched with children. It also has parts where it is too scary to watch. Audience shouldn't encourage movies like these which make no sense. It leaves a question mark in your mind after the movie is finished. The acting was good but the concept failed big time. Lots of scenes could've been edited out and the length of the movie could be short.

YourBossHere-00,31 October 2022,Just to balance the totally bogus rating I'm writing this to save someone's money and time and not fall into the trap of the high rating it is at now.,"Omg. It's definitely not a masterpiece which everyone was hyping about. I get it yes it's from South and u need to hype and it and praise just any product coming from there but atleast use the butter in limit not overdo it like u guys did here by making it the highest rated movie right now.Coming to the movie it was a snoozefest and a headache inducing movie . Snoozefest for how boring it was and headache for how boring it became and how i just wanted to leave the theatre and wishing for the climax to come as fast as possible.The movie plot is as generic as it can get we have thousands of movies with similar plot. Hero , Villian , Poor Rich , Village and Politicians. The movie met every criteria for how generic a plot can be written. The director actor producer didn't let anything distract him from writing such a plot which we have seen from last 30 years or more.The love story omg literally horrible and totally irrelevant didn't contributed anything for the plot it was just there to stretch the already way long movie . The first half was boring af but i still had some hope that second half might revive it but it became unbearable and i was sleeping in action scenes too and waiting for the climax. The love story had typical harrassment scenes which were romanticized as the heroine also didn't had any problem with . The comedy was also extremely forced and cringe like i was watching some 90's comedy movie. Acting was crap in many scenes apart from the Cop and Rishabh. Many scenes were like why is it even there , no need of those scenes they were just put to cross the 2 hour mark maybe for some reason. The heroine was completely useless as i said the love story didn't contributed even a bit .Everything can't be bad surely. The climax was good ( not great for sure ) the acting was great though which elevated the scene but i have seen such performance from Dhanush already in a much grounded version named Asuran which had similar plot but was much much better than this. Even people comparing it with a masterpiece like Tumbadd lol this is not even 10% of what that movie was . If u don't believe u are free to waste your time and money which I did too listening to other overhyped reviews and now regretting about it.",1/10,Kantara
foodiejerks,1 December 2022,Candidly Average Movie!! But Hyped Extremely!!,"Kantara is a good movie however I would not rate this movie as a blockbuster.Acting, Screenplay,Dialogues are good, actor who is a director, writer has some good skills.I believe concept could have been better, in mid time movie turned out to be bit stagnant which doesn't act has barrier. Suspense could have been better, it was quite obvious, about the villian, I think this needed a twist which would make audiences to think who might be the villian, easy thought process.Actress was perfect in her role, even other actors were blended in the movie, that's sometime rare to see.Overall would rate this movie - 6

madmax-18434,2 October 2022,One of the greatest movie in world cinema,"Rishabh Shetty is perhaps the greatest actor director in Indian cinema today. This movie takes you to a different world of TULUNADU and tells you an universal story of man and nature in a thrilling way. The climax is perhaps the best ever made in Indian cinema. After Heath ledger joker act in Dark Knight, this role of Rishabh is what I liked The most.It tells the story of sub altern people and their lives beliefs and Gods but in a very rooted and Indian way unlike anything you have seen on screen
The action is amazing and it is very entertaining with lot of comic dialogues which lighten the movie though it is heavy story. This is what makes Rishabh such a great writer and director.

He encounters an object; he becomes happy right at that moment. (I don't know, who understand it)
The dwellers, who look like a group of tribals, not actually villagers, suddenly appear. When the king wants that object and promises to give them anything they want in exchange for that. The villagers (more wild than general villagers) want the properties in exchange for happiness. That is, the villagers will give the king happiness/the object, but he has to give the jungle properties to the dwellers.Here I have listened to hoarse screams, I have seen everything, the object, the king, the villagers, but I didn't see the happiness.When the next generation claim the properties back, a dancer, but the villagers consider him God-like, vanishes without trace. It is not clear to me, who is the pig? Is that vanished dancer who born again as a pig. However, the demigod of the 2nd generation was the father of 3rd generation hero.The 2nd generation claimer dies without reason (some will say it is because of the villagers' curse). (I don't think it exists)Then the story starts with the 3rd generation of two parties.I won't repeat the story. The thing that disturbed me was that the 3rd generation claimer is a very good person in the entire movie. But suddenly becomes rude and violent (as if, the writer can write anything any moment), on the other hand, the (rude and bad) policeman becomes so gentle suddenly, despite almost killed by the 'hero' (as if, the writer can write anything any moment).Many are dying in the battle no one cares, but when a fatso (a joker friend of hero who has nothing to do with the story) dies, everyone after him.The hero is a superman, he can fight even with 100 and win despite taking (sedative charas, we called it ganja). This superman almost dies, but suddenly a ghost appears within him, he screams and screams, as if he is trying to make his viewers laugh. This superman cum ghost cum that dancer which vanished in the 2nd generation moment fix everything. And the villagers don't have to leave their homes.Then without any reason, the hero vanished like him, I already told twice who vanished.I don't know why this crap is called a masterpiece. What have other viewers found in this average movie but I don't find them. Very much overrated and overhyped. I think it is marketing (hype) which makes it very enjoyable for some masterpiece callers (or maybe paid reviewers and paid ratings).The hero has no quality of being a hero of a movie, I am not talking about the actor, I am talking about writing. How a hero who takes weed, kills animals, destroys jungle, makes chaos with the police, wrongfully.In some cases, the property owner has the right to get his property back. It is the villagers who wrongfully occupied the property.In one scene the 3rd generation son told his disabled son that, ""there was a king who was disabled like you"". It makes a point. Why a king would find happiness? What kind of nature of a person is this? Why would he find lots of happiness in an object? The villagers and the dancer cum demigod misguide the king and thus occupied his properties.Okay, let finish it, some I like are, the heroine, the jungle and some comedy.1 out of 5. Not recommended.",2/10,Kantara
rocksmani,3 December 2022,"Acting is good but too overhyped, one time watch!","Nothing great! One time watch. There are so many better movies than this that I can watch more than once but NOT this.Movie starts with a bang and goes really well but it has lose ends in the end. Director has tried something different and connected with audience however it could have been better! Most of us have witnessed so many good ones like Tumbbad, Pushpa, PK and many more which you can watch again n again because of their story telling, subject, acting, climax. This movie may get awards because of hype, not enough good movies produced this year and so on. In simple word - one time watch.

suyogwankhade,12 December 2022,Really overhyped,"Just typical south indian movie.This movie is just like any typical south indian movies following the same template: Over the top hero, sabka masiha, has friends who don't have any life but to die for the hero, random uncle with forced jokes, slow mo action sequence, end madhe villain ko marega, some irrelevant unnecessary romance with heroine who has no significance in the story, some sad backstory of hero and villain to justify all the nonsense they do.The last 5min were good, but it ended immediately. They could have focused on showing the concepts of dev but they focused on random fights and melodrama.

PYESR,29 November 2022,This seems to be a business of reviews. Overhyped to the core,"Watched the movie because I read so much about it being brilliant, different and what not.Did I find anything brilliant in this movie? No nothing.The overall acting was average from the lead actors. The RFO did justice to his role with this acting. The overall story had nothing to offer except in the beginning it felt like its going to be interesting but as the movie progressed, it was all about land grab and poor people fighting for their land. The super power gained by the lead at the end is the usual ending of such a mythical story.Not that the movie or the story was bad but then it was not a movie worth the hype being created all across. This clearly looks like a business of giving positive reviews to make the movie a hit.",6/10,Kantara
gnshkini,2 October 2022,Not just a movie but a spectacle,"I am out of words as i write this review. I was just blown away when i came out of the theater. With an excellent direction, brilliant cinematography its a visual treat. An excellent way to depict the bhoota kola culture. Cast was top notch with everyone doing justice to their roles.Kanthara means forest in sanskrit. Entire movie was shot in that setting telling the audience story about the people whose livelihood depends on the nature. Story is beautiful told and Rishab Shetty's acting was just mind-blowing. Soundtrack was also brilliant and its a movie which should be watched in the cinemas not just on your streamin devices. Worth watching this masterpiece again.

abhilashaa,8 November 2022,Hindi Dubbing too bad,"I don't know why is this movie so highly rated. I want to watch the movie just because of the reviews but was highly disappointed because this movie was stretched for 2 1/2 hours with so much pathetic Hindi special by the main characters mother and his girlfriend. I was waiting for the aah moment but it never arrived. Somehow I just could not enjoy the movie because of a lot of things may be the dubbing issue and the poor old storyline, and somehow I could not digest the fact that suddenly the inspector changed role. I also could not decipher why the God had to disappear to prove his point, then the actor took a rebirth for few seconds. The whole point was a little bit confusing for me.

opotraining,25 November 2022,Don't know why so much hype for this,"Finally watched this movie on OTT. The hype was totally fake. There is nothing worth watching in this movie. People say it's due to the song at the end which is now removed due to copyright. Even then the movie from stating to the end is nothing special. The main character is just annoying who does all kind of wrong things in the movie.The heros template is same like other south Indian movies village hero. Hero is poor. Hero doesn't have father. Hero is popular in entire village. Hero has few enemies due to his popularity. Hero always wins village sporting event. Hero lives for welfare of villagers. Hero has few side kicks for comedy. Hero drinks, smokes , hunts wild boars(new in this movie) teases women and it's made to look cool. Hero has a lover. Hero has romantic songs. Hero as usual can beat 20plus guys alone with his hands. The hero gets angry and keeps screaming screaming everytime for silly reason. The story is also usual rich vs poor. Only Climax has something interesting where the hero dances , screams a lot which is also irritating sometimes and fights but build up to climax is totally boring.People just give higher rating just because it is from south and the hype around it. Totally not worth the time.",1/10,Kantara

And not what it promises to be.","The initial moments of the movie were good where they showed this demigod and a king who made a deal with this Demigod, and the movie got bad to worst from that moment. We as viewers keep waiting for the movie to follow up on the story of this Demigod and we as viewers keep witnessing the lead actor smoking, drinking, assaulting and being a complete dork. And i could have been okay what the lead actor was doing, if they movie was less about him and more about the mythology around this Demigod.God what a cringefest what this movie is.And i am being very generous with my 3 stars, anything more then that is too much for this movie.

Instead of wasting ur time by watching the entire movie instead u can only watch first 10 minutes and last twenty minutes, in the rest of the movie nothing is happening which will keep u occupied.It's stretched beyond toleration limit.There is unnecessary hype about this movie! It doesn't match the buzz it carries, it's utterly disappointing.Keep ur expectations low if u still want to watch it and waste ur time. VFX are poor , performances are not great.

gajendrasonare,9 November 2022,Overrated,"I went to watch this movie because of reading so many good reviews but believe me there is nothing special about this movie. Typical south Indian fight scenes. Unnecessary jump scares which have no purpose. I watched in theatre and I regret it because it gave me headache due to its extra loud soundtracks and screamings. The movie is also very slow moving at first. I fell asleep in initial 30 minutes. I can't believe how this mediocre movie have such a high rating. I always watch movies after reading reviews but this time it is just disappointing. I am not impressed with this movie. If you want to watch it then don't expect too much.

arpit-mishra,29 November 2022,Good but overrated,"This is a masala movie with some artistic touch. I feel it is hyped to the moon and you may feel underwhelmed after watching it. Totally predictable but the last 15 minutes are worth waiting. Atleast 20 minutes of the film could have been edited out. But still I think the movie has heart and shows us that a cinematicaly beautiful film is possible to make in budget. I saw some reviews and film essays after watching the movie and just can't understand how people can say it is beyond understanding. I may sound little harsh but it is because I felt cheated by all those YouTube movies reviewers who hyped this film like crazy.

shrimadiwalar,27 November 2022,Shows promise. Ends up as usual.,"After having been told by many people to watch this, I went in with high expectations.But was disappointed within few minutes as I figured, it follows the same story telling style of every South Indian movie nowadays: too rushed, lot of unnecessary background score, too fast paced, and a khichdi of a story.Although, the actual concept behind the script is quite interesting and unique, it could have been used in a much better way. Instead, the main concept has not been given too much time on screen. Rather, a lot of time, the story revolves around the daily tasks of the main protagonist, the village politics and lot of other things, which is rather unnecessary. The movie could have been atleast 45 minutes shorter by taking out the unnecessary parts. Instead they could have revolved more around the mysterious concept and created a masterclass.I would compare this with Tumbbad (Both mysteries, but completely different concepts). That movie is a masterclass, with no unnecessary hoolabaloo and delivering on point with mystery and thrill.Personally, i prefer a slower pace, giving some time for character development. The fast paced story telling is simply not for me.There are still quite a few good moments in this movie. The jumpscares are pretty good. (There are only a couple of them). Although, script could have been better, the actors have done a very good job. Fight scenes (mandatory in every South Indian movie. Don't understand why) are good.The scenes of the summoning of the Demigod especially has been done very well.Overall, the movie is a good watch, but could have really done much better with better writing and editing. I would have loved to see more of Demigod Panjurli. But all we get is a few fleeting scenes and the last scene.",4/10,Kantara

YouTubeblack,17 October 2022,Masterpiece? Hell no.,"There is a trend now in India to hype up all the south films irrespective of how good or bad they are. The same has happened with this film too. By no means this is a bad film but to be honest, it's neither a masterpiece.The film has a strong start, you feel like you are watching old school legends about the supernatural but it does not last long. The first 20 mins and the last 10 mins has the UNIQUE factor in the film which is mostly making people go crazy but to keep things in perspective is that enough given the fact that it's a 2hr 30min long film? The performances by the main cast are good and especially great in the climax but everything in the middle is just fluff.You can see shades of pushpa and even Asuran in terms of setting, conflicts between the authorities and the common villegers. At the core it's just another the oppressed vs the oppresor theme which has been seen multiple times in South cinema, and Asuran is a great example of how it's done. Kantara feels flat in the middle with the same tropes of South Indian cinema and offers nothing new except the first and the Last act.",6/10,Kantara

arungeorge13,25 November 2022,A film that should have focused on its mythical layers much more! [+53%],"I'm probably in the minority here, but Kantara is a film that has the chosen one template written all over it. The protagonist is a typical ruffian who blindly supports the landlord (the obvious bad guy, if you sharply observed the first act), opposes the police officer who goes by the rule-book, and is oddly connected to the lore of the land. It has a fantastic opening stretch (the plagiarized music has been replaced with something less impactful on OTT streaming) where elements of magical realism are effectively positioned. Right from the moment the protagonist was introduced and his arc commenced, I tuned out. The extremely drab romance (nothing unusual in masala films), the generic ""oppose-the-cop"" narrative, and the vain attempts at humour had me woah-ing (in a distasteful way) more than the demigod itself. The less said about the women characters, the better.Thankfully, the film redeems itself somewhat in its final act. I was able to let some aspects in the screenplay (such as the underwritten cop character suddenly having a change of mind, the predictable twist) slide for the sake of the stunningly choreographed set-pieces. The feudal and casteist angles (the villagers not allowed to enter the landlord's house) are frequent motifs but not strongly written or depicted to evoke a ""fight back"" feeling. I think Rishab Shetty spent a little too much time in the film's mid-portions where nothing noteworthy was being conveyed. I'm sure the material connects with the people from coastal Karnataka a lot better. It is essentially a film made by them, for them.",5/10,Kantara
AMOGHREVIEWS,15 October 2022,TERRIFIC,"A Technical Masterpiece That Is Raw, Deeply Rooted & Gives A Never Seen Before Experience To The Audience... Rishab Shetty Shines As The Director As Well As The Protagonist... His Electrifying Performance, Especially In The Final 20 Minutes Is Sure To Give You Goosebumps... Kishore Is Equally Good & Same Goes For Achyuth Kumar... Arvind S. Kashyap's Cinematography Is Amusing & Deserves Applause + Accolades... The Way He Has Captured Forests, Villages & The 'Bhoota Kola' Ritual Is Superb... On The Whole, ""Kantara"" Is Another Milestone From The Kannada Film Industry After KGF Series, 777 Charlie & Ulidavaru Kandanthe... It's Not Just A Film, But An Emotion That Can Be Felt On The Big Screen Only... Highly Recommended!

noursayed,25 November 2022,Don't believe the reviews.,"Because of the high ratings and reviews for this movie, I was very excited to watch it, but after I finished watching it, I felt sad that I wasted two and a half hours of my time on this rubbish.The movie had a good start, but after that I don't know what happened to the story. I didn't even like the main hero because of his disgraceful actions, and you want me to look forward to him. Even the movie's climax that people were talking about was very short. The movie is like food that smells good but tastes the worst.I don't put many reviews on this site but please save yourselves and don't watch it unless you like to torture yourselves.

jaheranny,24 November 2022,Crap movie if you are not related to this culture. A regional Movie.,"It doesn't give a proper thrill, or drama feel.It's just bland. People show affections nowadays as this is a south movie or a movie with their culture. People are getting more and more chauvinistic and and shows oblivion about proper judgement. It's not for the viewers worldwide. I can't even finish it, In the halfway, I have to skip many of its parts. Indian Movies, most of their gross incomes, and even their ratings in IMDb are biased. Most of the Indian viewers don't know any rating between the range 2 to 9. They like the movie provide fine 10 ratings, and don't go with their taste, culture, religion, opinion, they shower it with devastating rating 1/2.In personal account, I don't like that movie even a bit. So that's my rating.

its_me_rajit,15 October 2022,Woooow,"Creating a movie out of folklore is becoming a seperate genre in previous years. ""Tumbadd ""excelled it so as ""vikram Veda "" in thriller genre. Kantara takes a floklore blends into the story and comes up with a gem. The storyline is compact,the visuals are stunning, the community is believable and action sequences are organic.The story shows the dynamics between the Saheb (the aristocrat) ,shiva(leader of the ethnic group) and a government (forest officer). The ecosystem is disrupted because of the incidents which unfolds slowly in this masterful piece. It's not a movie it's joyerny which takes you to the village forgotten. Some background displays are so delicately placed in the movie . Just check the background of ""veerappan news""played in the radio in one of the scenes. A subtle way to foreshadow how the things can happen if matters not negotiated properly
Shiva gets a lot of screen time shines like a diamond. The forest officer is played convincingly. The saheb is okay in its role.Watch it to know the jungle,tribes and folklores. Lovely visual treat created by rishab shetthy.",8/10,Kantara
mohanrajugihsrah,2 October 2022,More than Mind Blowing,"Every Scene from strating of the story
They try to carry a ancient story from that part to the climax, you never get bored for a sec if you understand the language. And the special mention about climax is "" Fell it in Theatre with that sound effects"". Even just think about it creates goosebumps now also......
Never miss this movie experience in Theatre...
One of the Karnataka culture is perfectly shown in this film with a Great direction, Perfect BGM score, Mind blowing Acting by every Acters, Cinematography is at its best and even one scene form movie you can't find the graphics or VFX that much of Reality shooting is done by the team
Thanks Team Kantara for this great Movie.

prateekganji,2 October 2022,Masterpiece Of Indian Cinema,"Rishabh Shetty has shown every aspect of the village very sensitively whether it may be thier traditions, culture, dressing, their festival, daily livelihood, food, untouchability, Injustice upon his village people in some scenes their innocence everything it was complete package of cinematic experience. No one could have presented this film as excellent as Rishabh Shetty has Presented simply Amazing.Action is also so natural you will fall in love with his action.Talking about the technical department making is top notch hatsoff to Hombale films and Vijay Kiragandur Sir for bringing out the best of Rishabh Shetty without compromising in budget, background score by Ajaneesh Loknath is mind-blowing, and talking about DOP Arvind Kashyap has done amazing and ultimate job all characters are well developed and all have acted well Lastly the leader of the movie Actor as well as director
Rishabh Shetty has done a fabulous job by creating a cultural masterpiece, comedy and dialogue are also very good last but not the least
talking about the climax one has to experience it just experience it We should not review or we can't give ratings for that climax it is one of the Best climax of Indian Cinematic history in my opinion. Just go and experience this masterpiece movie in your nearby theatres.",10/10,Kantara
auri-93585,17 October 2022,The most gripping climax in Indian Cinema!,"Here comes a once in a lifetime movie! The story weaves itself from the past into the present nicely. The dhaiva aradhana is the centerpiece and gives it a deserved recognition. The language, nuances, and culture is depicted well.The story is true to life and the performances are great. The role of the mother is outstandingly played by Manasi. Achyuth Kumar is versatile and carries his role very well. Supported by the entire cast and crew, very true to life dialogues and events. The absorption of the spirit into a human body transforming itself into a whole new avatar is engrossing.This one is for the big screen.

Never expected climax acting to be this much by Rishab shetty !!! It's a top notch!!Final thought ,this movie should be celebrated for it's making, story line,content, performance by all the lead and supporting actors and Kishore Sir , Achyut Kumar Sir performance is great as always , it's a must watch for everyone.Not to mention ,this is my first time review for a film and i couldn't stop myself to write about the film..

chadhakannav,28 December 2022,Overhyped and below average,"The last 10 mins of the movie are okay else it is just an overhyped below average movie. The male protagonist drinks liquor, kills wild animals, smokes weed, objectifies woman and engages in deforestation and extreme violence. There is no social message of why all this is wrong and might be an encouragement for the viewers to indulge in these malpractices. Few of the scenes are absolutely cringy and the script is predictable. The writing is loose at my parts of the movie. I waited for months to watch this movie but I am very disappointed with all the hype around it. Still could not understand how this was a spiritual experience for many people.",5/10,Kantara

However, that was not the case at all, people have showcased herd mentality on this one.About the movie, the story is pretty straightforward (nothing new) but thats not at all bad if the screenplay and acting are good enough but in this case it is not the case. Rishab Shetty's acting is alright, nothing to boast about. Like other recent movies, this one also has a tinge of negative portrayal of masulinity This is a mediocore movie at best and I have seen lots of under rated movies better than this one in every aspect of cinema.

Depicting Supreme God Vishnu's third incarnation on earth called Varaha avtar. The forest tribal community devote to Varaha and considers bhootakola(divine dance of coastal kannada) performer to rudra (Lord Shiva) who is gatekeeper of the community and protects every devotee of Lord Varaha from evil spirits(living/dead).. A promise of ancestors is under threat to be breached by people over lust of materialistic gains where the ancient king had made deal with demigods as bargain for his peace. With such powerful storyline, excellent performance by every actor keeping raw background showing beautiful traditional practices of coastal Karnataka in an ultimate showdown of good vs evil.In 1847 a king is happily living with his family and empire but what he does not have is peace and goes to search it at various places. He comes to a tribal village where he sees Davia which could offer him peace but he has to give some forest land to the tribal people in order to seek peace.

KANTARA is just an average south indian movie, what we already have seen many times in south indian cinema...same dirty helpless poor people...same rich bad people... the plot was very predictable...yes, I agree action scenes & DEVTA part was good but then this movie very much helped me to dose off in the theatre again...(first one was SAHOO)...I was struggling to keep myself awake as I didn't want to miss the action scenes... after watching this movie I have taken an oath...i will never get carried away by the FAKE HYPE created by south indians...and will think 10 times before purchasing a TICKET...

Characters are loosely written and the main diety is not fleshed out as it should have been to keep audience engaged.Just a typical revenge story with supernatural elements added to it.",3/10,Kantara

yogeshevolution,21 October 2022,So much overhyped and overrated.,"The movie is good i am not saying it is all that bad but rating it 10 really i was shocked . A good story but feels similar to other movies like karnan, asuran . Just impresses with 1st 15 min. And then on same old predictable story about poor and rich,greed and politics . Even got bored in between. Surely Not a masterpiece by miles as people are stating. Nothing extraordinary. Just simple good story executed well but nothing new . I think lately people are fake rating movies on platforms to get movie more attention which is really bad. If this goes on soon rating concept will be laid to waste really and it will be hard to distinguish between good and medicore movies.

Remove it and you have nothing.But yes if you are into cheap adult comedy, you may enjoy certain scenes in this movie.

mailnairvi,27 November 2022,Too much of overdramatic scenes.. only the ending song is good.,"This movie has a very typical story and the same plot of landowners vs locals dispute with some extremely overwhelming behaviour by the protoganist whi is also kind of someone who treats and sexualizes women as objects. Every scene is exaggerated.The charismatic part of the movie is the dakshina Kannada/south karnataka ritual which is beautiful. The song in the end with the dange art form is merismerising. There are however allegations that this song is copied from a song made 5 years ago called navarasam. I have watched the start of it and it does have an uncanny resemblance. The theme of the bands song itself seems like the movie plot. If this is true then the production house should apologize and give credit to the creators. But even with the song, I think the movie is extremely overhyped. It's nothing great but a typical story with a glorious song. 10/10 for the song in the ending.. 5/10 for the rest of the movie.points for copying and not giving credit to small independent artists.",4/10,Kantara
santubhattacharjee,27 October 2022,Can't understand why people going bizarre about this movie,"To be honest, I totally knew the story before stepping into the theatre but still hoped for a surprising or amazing visual and audio experience that people are praising vehemently. I watched the whole movie with that expectation. But me and many others were definitely misled. The movie is nothing but a loud action over-the-top south Indian flick. Maybe people have put their divine and spiritual view while watching but as a true movie buff who appreciates movies irrespective of the language, i can say it is totally disappointing. The climax people are praising about is so loud i had to close my ears. I just couldn't find a single person in the theatre who was satisfied with the movie. I can see why good Indian movies are not appreciated as these bogus movies are.. sole reason is that 80% people don't apply their own senses and just follow the herd. Praise whatever majority praise and boycott whatever majority says. No brains applied.

ashishjasu,24 November 2022,"Overhyped Movie,Only the Climax was Worth Watching","I think People who are calling this movie a Masterpiece does not really knows what actually is a Masterpiece movie. Movies like ""The Shawshank Redemption,3 Idiots, Jersey(2019),96,Premam,KGF Part 1"" deserves to be called as a Masterpiece. But People now a days started calling every single movie a Masterpiece. This movie is like something you have already seen except the last 10 minutes. Last few minutes were the only true deserving moments where this movie is creating so much buzz around. The acting is top notch. But the story was normal. I have already seen many movies with this type of story. Many people are trying to emphasize on the fact that this movie has shown the beauty of the respected culture. It was shown indeed but not much enough. So overall I want to say that this movie was overhyped by the people who blindly supports South Indian movies and think that if a particular movie is from South,then it has to be good. Even I am a South Indian,but I didn't liked movies like Pushpa,KGF 2. They don't even deserve the ratings of 8/10.

The start was okayish, with clean graphics, not overkilling the experience and what followed after the start was an ABSOLUTE nightmare!!!!The film does not have anything to offer than a lame story of feudal lords exploiting the poor. The execution is also so pathetic that it does not go above the mediocre level. This was the point I was waiting anxiously for the climax, for all the hype surrounding the finale and Rishab's performance.The climax was even disastrous, not sure what kind of performance was that from Rishab, it was just average and at times the loud scream was irritating, I did not feel any divinity in this movie at all, it was far far away to bring peace within me, I was irritated and broken to see a failed movie being celebrated like a cult classic.Nowadays, the greatest fear is checking social media reviews for sincere opinions.

sarthsrivastava,8 January 2023,Overhyped,"I don't understand why people are creating so much hype about this below average movie , This movie had all the qualities of a bad movie . Bad storytelling, No character development, No emotions , No thrill ,No comedy, bad dialogues . Whats the point of watching a movie if it's not entertaining or conveying any message properly? May be the kannada people can connect with it but the movie is so not upto the mark to connect to the other audience. Bollywood has made so much better thrillers like Andhadhun And Monica oh my darling i am not going to suggest this to someone instead of those . Wake up people don't create hype for something non deserving like kantara. And no one in the critics is talking about how cheesy its lovestory was atleast tell the truth which can be clearly seen in the movie , everyone is stuck on the climax and that too is below average. People are just respecting what kannad cinema has made in such a low budget and their dedication but that is not going to make the movie super and Oscar deserving.

siddharth-61578,15 November 2022,Poorest form of Dubbing & High Pitch Sound,"The story and acting is top notch. Ppl from South India will love the movie as they can easily get connected to culture of Tribal people and Demigods. For others it will be bit difficult to digest the movie. Sometimes it gets to a level which renders movie unwatchable further. The main reason majority of Bollywoodians will not like the movie is poorest form of dubbing and extremely loud noise throught the movie. It becomes unbearable after half an hour. If dubbing improves and noise decibals reduces then movie can become somewhat enjoyable.If you need a different kind of movie experience and can tolerate extremely high pitch sound for almost 3 hours and if you can ignore most garbage dubbing till date, then go for it.

Biswas_,1 April 2022,Why this film didn't release in theaters?,"If MSD : THE UNTOLD STORY could release on the big screen , then why didn't this film. I genuinely feel this is another untold story that needed a wider audience to witness.KPT covers two journeys of Pravin Tambe, one, his journey from the small tournaments to the big stage IPL and Ranji and two, his journey from being a medium pacer to a leg spinner.The man kept fighting for a place in the ranji for and kept practicing for years despite his age going against his ambition. His job was a headache still he didn't give up. This is the inspiring tale of the man Pravin Tambe, who went on to make a hattrick on debut against KKR .KPT definitely gives off the MSD biopic vibes but it is of a shorter length . Shreyas Talpade gets to show his superb talent he posseses with this role. The final match between RR and KKR has been choreographed really well despite limited budget.Also thr film never gets boring. It is always entertaining or emotional or inspiring.Flaws : Parambrata's part is a waste addition. Also, the final call up for Pravin to RR was really abrupt. No information as to how RR selected him is given which is why it felt so abrupt. The guy who played Rahul Dravid was hilariously bad.Overall, if you loved the MSD biopic, you will definitely love KPT. It is an inspiration. And it is engaging as well. Also, that one song that plays in this film is superb, reminded me of Besabriyaan of MSD biopic.",10/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?
magadalwarmayur,1 April 2022,Best sports drama after Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,"I'm cricket fan we don't get too many cricket based film and when we do most of them are terrible I was the most disappointed when 83 film was released the film had a lot of potential but can't deliver the productEvery Indian cricket fan knows the story about Praveen tambey this film tries to capture the struggle of the player and it does tremendously well the film is very personal and it doesn't lack in anything it will keep you engagedWhen the film is done you would have a sense of awe
The film successfully captured the struggle of Pravin tambe,without a shadow of doubt the best film I have seen based on cricket after Iqbal. And one of the best sports drama based on real person I have seen after Bhaag Milkha bhag.

deepakshettigar-91670,1 April 2022,Story should be heard,"Some untold stories are much greater than the stories we know. Some are legends because of cricket. Cricket is a legend because of such characters who have love and passion for the game. Such is a story of Pravin Tambe who get through the odds with his sheer persistence and hardwork achieves the goal at the penultimate phase of the career. Actually it is incorrect to say that, because it is believed that cricketers end their career at the age of 40, whereas this man achieved new heights at the age of 41.

kuldeepkholia,1 April 2022,The Shawshank Redemption of Sports Biopics,"You don't need to be a legend always to inspire. Sometimes all you need is an honest, sincere & continuous effort. Pravin Tambe is a 40+ struggling cricketer, who didn't get a chance to prove his talent and his career looks to end even before it starts. But, the only ray of hope is his honest dedication towards his life that is Cricket. When all seems over, life gives him a super over. The Wall, Rahul Dravid, spots his talent & he gets into the playing 11 of Rajasthan Royals for the most astonishing franchise league of cricket in the world, IPL. His debut comes at an age when most players get retired. At a crucial juncture, when the opponents are about to chase the score made by Rajasthan, Pravin Tambe gets his debut over & guess what, he takes a hattrick. On top of that, he becomes the highest wicket taker in that IPL Tournament. Above all, this is an absolutely üíØ true story. What an inspirational story that requires your patience, but rewards you handsomly! Must Watch. Simple, yet super special. Boy next door, yet a superhero. Soulful performance of Shreyas Talpade.

WhyLieReviews,1 April 2022,Upcoming Biopic makers must take note of this one,"Biopics sure have an advantage with a ready-story. But that comes with its own challenges.You cannot use much of your imagination (fictional ideas).Yet, you need to impress the audience. Make the audience watch. Keep it interesting.To be honest, 'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' movie kept me more engaged than '83'.'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' seemed quite genuine, no unnecessary masala, sticks to the biopic's cause, shows you the end-to-end story coverage and keeps you rooting for the hero.Sure, 'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' may not be among the best indian biopics out there. If i recall, i'm sure 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' was a much better story teller.But, after a long time, 'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' showed why biopics can be interesting.Shreyas Talpade is a very under-rated actor. Such roles, especially biopic characters, are his specialities. He debuted as a cricketing character in his 1st movie after all.Must watch - if you can sit through a good drama / biopic.",8/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?
iamsankho,1 April 2022,The Story Everyone Should Know,"""Main Bas Ekbar Ranji Khelna Chahta hoon"" - The life story of Pravin Tambe should be known by every single person who is struggling. Believe me, you will never see something more inspiring than this. My respect for Tambe sir have increased much more. I was so moved after watching the movie. Kudos to Shreyas Talpade- no one could've played the character better. JUST WATCH IT. One of the best sports dramas ever made in India.

He then went on to play for Mumbai Ranji Team.Kaun Pravin Tambe? Is an inspirational story about one of the oldest debuts in professional cricket. Shreyas Talpade steps into Tambe's shoes to give us an outstanding, heartfelt performance. This biopic is another example that proves age is just a number. Tambe never gave up on his dream of playing cricket. He worked odd jobs at odd hours just so that he could fit in cricket into his schedule. Anjali Patil, who plays his onscreen wife is excellent as Vaishu. Ashish Vidyarthi, Parambrata Chattopadhyay co-star.Kaun Pravin Tambe? Is by far the best film released under Disney+ Hotstar Multiplex. There are some chinks though; these come in the form of pacing issues.

It moves around cricket but parallely its an inspirational movie. It says that age is just a number and dreams can be achieved at anytime at any age with strong determination and hard work. When the desire is very strong everything becomes possible. Complete family movie and it is highly recommended.

hiteshhatwar,1 April 2022,"It's all about passion, persistence and performance!!","Persistence is something that can be easy to talk about than to implement it in actuality.Loved the way the emotions of the struggling Pravin Thambe is depicted. Almost makes us feel ""not again!!!"" about his misfortunes, and failures inspite of consistent struggles. Yet another best thing about the movie is, while lot of biopic these days are busy in promoting some kind of hate propoganda for protagonist's failure on someone who was successful, it doesn't contain any kind of aligations for the sufferings and misfortunes one has to go through.Fun fact is while looking at his repeated rejections, our lack of commitment kicks in and makes us wish he stops trying after this!Not recommended if you are into flowery all good and comdey drama's. It's a Bio-pic. About how hard life can hit someone.If you loved Pursuit of Happyness, this movie just takes the success inspite of the rejections and misfortunes into whole another level, as the man who lived that life in itself is something to ponder upon.",10/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

mitrajtrath,29 April 2022,Kaun Pravin Tambe?A loser who never gave up,"Some movies are made for entertainment whereas some movies remind you of the power that movies have & this film revives that power that helps restore belief in oneself.The biopic does complete justice to the story of this amazing fighter who fulfilled his dream at the age of 41 ,something he's been dreaming of ever since he was 12 years old.Backed by powerful performances from Shreyash Talpade,Parambrata & other supporting actors,the storytelling beautifully depicts the early life,personal life of Pravin Tambe in the first half followed by hard hitting drama in the second half. The cinematography was good too with the matches being displayed well.Thanks to the fine direction ,we're exposed to the situation of Pravin very well. His closest ones stopping to believe in him,his friends calling him a mad man, it's full of social ironies that take place when a man fails to achieve something ,thereby building up to that moment when he hits it.Overall a very inspiring movie which you can watch with whole family. I highly recommend not to miss this one. Take the message out of it,you'll remember the name Pravin Tambe for a long time!",9/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

The last 15 minutes of the movie were extremely touching However the movie at 2hrs 13 minutes was a bit too long,and should have been reduced by about 20 minutes or so.5/10.

reiya-32720,14 April 2022,Tasty but without spice.,"A good movie but lacks punch or moments where emotion takes over , it runs at a steady pace and keeps moving the message is good Talpade has acted well it's an inspiring story but it's like eating a fish without spice.Advice - Watch if you are an admirer of King Bruce.

SoumikBanerjee25,30 July 2022,"There is no apparent 'elevation', the Screenplay mostly falls flat!","The film might work as a fruitful catalyst for motivational reasons, precisely catered toward that older section of sportsman who has faced countless rejections and refusals in the past or is currently going through a bad patch in their respective sports careers; but for someone like me who belongs to the normal segment of the audience, this execution failed to exhibit the kind of persuasiveness I was anticipating!Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way undermining the accomplishments of Pravin Tambe nor the fascination & the unyielding sentiment he had with 'Gentleman's Game'. It's just that I missed the same determination and intensity that is generally expected and is a must-have in my opinion, in such commercially viable sports dramas!Normally, I do not prefer drawing unwarranted comparisons, but here, in this case, I need to make a rare exception! Just take the likes of 83', Jhund, Jersey (both the Telugu original and the Bollywood remake), or even one of Shreyas Talpade's earliest works i.e. Iqbal; in spite of being different films made in different periods, they all seemed to have something in common, ""Vehemence & Enthusiasm"". Unlike here, where the script tends to get barraged with incessant inconsistencies and overpowering flaws! The kind of flaws that can not be disregarded!",5/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

IPyaarCinema,16 August 2022,Inspirational,"Shreyas Talpade plays Pravin Tambe in the biopic. He is a perfect choice as he not only fits the background profile but also has prior experience with a sports-based drama, particularly cricket.Right from the start, Shreyas Talpade lives in the role. It also helps him that a big chunk of it involves light-hearted drama with the family, friends and colleagues at the office. He nails those segments, and when it comes to cricket, it is alright.The first thing that catches our mind is the smooth and organic flow of the narrative. The director takes us into the world of Pravin Tambe instantly.The sheer unbelievable journey of the cricketer holds attention. It is more appealing for a cricket enthusiast who also follows the Indian Premier League. The speciality, debut at such late age, and the records. At the end, there is a bout of positive energy and a feel-good factor looking at the journey, and that's the success and takeaway from Kaun Pravin Tambe. It gives an inspirational feeling.",7/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?
vjnambu,30 July 2022,Best biopic from Bollywood in recent times,"Bollywood is today running short of creativity. For easy cashgrab they depend either on remakes or biopics. Some of the bipics worked while others were misfire. Now, here comes another biopic kaun pravin tambe? Does this deliver or not?I didn't know anything about pravin tambe nor i have seen his matches. So watching this film was a fresh experience for me. It narrates the story of pravin tambe, who dreams to play ranji cricket. Despite being burdened of supporting his family, he didn't give up his dreams by strictly working in those companies which has a cricket club. He luckily got work in a company where the boss was passionate for cricket. But when that company shut down, pravin struggled to find a company where he could play cricket. Despite reaching late 30s he tried to get selection in ranji and for its practice in daytime, he had to work at nights as a bartender in a dance bar. When everyone gives up on him, he gets the opportunity to play IPL.What I liked the most about the film is its lighthearted tone which makes it a pleasant watch. I liked the dynamics between pravin's family which is very relatable. Another thing i liked was that like usual biopics pravin is not shown as a flawless or a saint like character. In a scene, his coach advises him to do spin bowling which he disobeys and continues playing medium pace. He does not change his bowling style despite the team losing because of him. The film takes quiet time in pravin to realise his potential in spin bowling. The ipl match in the ending was well shot compared to ms dhoni. It ends on a really satisfactory note.Shreyas talpade was very good as pravin tambe. His lovable personality and innocence makes his stubborn attitude also look good. I grew up watching ashish vidyarthi as a villain. Very rarely he plays a positive role. This film would be his most memorable positive role. Anjali patil was also brilliant as pravin's wife. Rest of the actors have also done their job well.On the whole, kaun pravin tambe is a best biopic which came in Bollywood during recent times. Its fun, entertaining, emotional and inspirational too.",10/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

Drawbacks were music could've been more better and some of the details were missed , especially how he was selected by RR team was not shown properly .

chand-suhas,7 December 2022,Sometimes all you need is that one good over.,"This is a story of relentless Pravin Tambe to make it to the Ranji team at any cost. A dream he dreamt since he was 12 years old. I randomly know him as an IPL player who debuted when he was 40+ but the struggle behind his journey was indeed worth checking out. Shreyas Talpade after Iqbal once again gets to be part of a cricket based movie, this time a biography and he has given his best to this role.The screenplay opts for non-linear narrative initially with constant flashbacks but the tone is consistent throughout. Same goes for the pace, it is a slow drama and I cannot say it is devoid of entertainment. It merely signifies documenting Pravin's simple life, his relationships and his struggle to make it in this sport. Narrated through a journalist with a personal tiff with Pravin was a nice touch as well. There aren't many gimmicks to hype up any scene and with regards to the end product, this is what made it much closer to the heart.Worth checking out for one man's never let go attitude in achieving his dream.",6/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

And when he finally achieves what he aspired for his whole life you can do nothing but smile with a tear rolling down your cheeks.Shreyas Talpade did it in Iqbal and now he does again in Pravin Tambe.It's a great entertaining film you can watch with your family.

He ""Held"" purple cap for few matches but never won it. There is difference between these two words.Rahul Dravid asks him to come play for Rajasthan Royals and then we see him in a match between Rajasthan vs Kolkata in which he took hat trick which looked like it was his first match and first over in IPL. He makes his IPL debut in 2013 and took hat trick in 2014. So stop misleading in the shake of some heroics sympathy which director wants to gain. You can't mislead or give wrong information to audience in movies like that.

At a time when Sachin Tendulkar and M S Dhoni were chided for playing till 40 yrs , Pravin Tambe debuting at 42 yrs is an act of sheer will, determination and gumption. His faith in his game surpassed all barriers both physical and psychological. The movie was made brilliantly for all cricket fans and Rahul Dravid opening the movie was truly special. Our society gives a lot of importance to age and forgets that age is just a number. Way to Go . We should focus more on such unsung heroes in future .

All thanks to the OTT releases, a large audience would get chance to witness one of the best sports drama that Indian cinema has ever made. A story revolves around pravin tambe, now 50 year old cricketer who never gave away on his dream to play a ranji. Cricket in India and specially in Mumbai is not just a sport, but an emotion. This movie covers it perfectly.Shreyas talpade is back on big screen after so many years and gave a perfect performance. But Anjali Patil came out as total surprise, she played an important role of pravin tambe's wife and did an exceptional work portraying the support system. Movie had many actors and entire cast did a phenomenal job to play their role and to keep up with the emotions of the story.But the main hero of this movie is its gripping screenplay. No nuisance around it. Mixture of few funny moments made this movie less dramatical and helped in keeping it more realistic. Direction is good, no time is wasted on any gimmick.Its a great watch and a must must watch.",10/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?
HarshVardhan,10 April 2022,This is the true cinema... A true biopic!,"Fantastic movie!! The movie keeps you gripped throughout the time. There's no unnecessary emotional drama or stupid Love story masala here. The marvelous acting by Shreyas Talpade will definitely make you stand in shoes of Pravin Tambe. You might get goosebumps and tears in your eyes by the time this movie ends.The story telling is excellent. Direction, screenplay, background score, acting, they are all so perfect that you will actually get emotionally attached to the film.In today's time, entire bollywood is just either about a remake movie or a biopic. Filmmakers nowadays choose famous personalities for a biopic story in order to catch the limelight and do big business. But unlike the other biopic movie, what differentiates 'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' is that, you are totally unaware about the protagonist. Till date only few know about this guy and none know about his life. And this justifies the title of this film.The confidence, the patience and such strong belief in one's dream is what you learn from this story.I definitely will insist you to spare sometime for this movie. Now when the bollywood movies have become a pure business, movies like 'Kaun Pravin Tambe?' are pure form of art. And it's our responsibility to patronize this effort of genuine filmmakers for being true to their passion instead of minting money in the name of stupid films.Thank you. I hope you enjoy.",10/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?

amit1717,10 April 2022,Gold standard of Sports Biopic,"Kaun Pravin Tambe? That's what most people would say when you mention his name in a room full of people. That's because in today's world of fandom and glamour, there is only a minute chance that a simplistic cricketer like Tambe might find a place. And the makers have gone ahead and taken that chance, and executed it marvellously.One of the brilliant things about this movie is that unlike most Indian biopics, the makers have tended to keep focus in and around Tambe, and cricket, with masala content kept to minimum. The songs carry the story ahead, and showcase various personal moments from Tambe's life that define his journey, and struggles, in the path to becoming a champion cricketer. The story doesn't have too much of added fictitious narratives, and most part of it seems very real. The cinematography is amazing, makes you feel that you're really watching a 2022 movie, and not some budget B-movie. The pacing is fine, we can experience the Tambe story unfolding piece by piece as the movie progresses, giving us moments of laughter, sadness, glory and heartbreaks. Although they could have tried making the climax a bit longer, and maybe slightly more charismatic. Overall, the movie is amazing to watch.One of the things that the movie missed to mention is the 5-wicket knock that Tambe took in an Abu Dhabi T10 game. This particular knock is important because of two reasons : Firstly, you can bowl only a maximum of 2 overs in a T10 match, and taking 5 wickets in just 12 balls is just something epic. Secondly, the wickets that he took were : Chris Gayle, Eoin Morgan, Kieron Pollard, Fabian Allen and Upul Tharanga, out of which the middle three were a hat-trick. Such is the legend of Pravin Tambe.",9/10,Kaun Pravin Tambe?
ruchitiwariguru,2 April 2022,Must Watch movie,"It's rare to see good movies from Bollywood these days. This is one is an exception, thank god the film don't have any unnecessary gyan and secularism display like other Hindi movies. The journey of player is captured beautifully.

It's Just Motivating One! The Stubborn Decision On Not Giving Up And Achieving The Dream. Dreams Do Come True. To Live And Achieve A Dream One Need To Face Many Obstacles And Challenges. Those Who Give Up Can't Achieve, Those Who Tries To Do Their Best Are Appreciable But Those Who Stick To Their Path Facing The Circumstances Are Real Heroes. They Are Different From All. They Are Unique From All. This Was The Whole Message Of This Film. Coming To Acting Shreyas Was The Only Person Who Could Play This Role Genuinely. The Body Structure He Developed For This Film Was Unexpectable As He Looked Same As Real Pravin. He Realy Did A Hard work For This Role. I Remember His Debut Film Iqbal Where He Was Trained As A Cricketer So He Had A Knowledge About The Game So He Performed Well In This Movie. Coming To Supporting Cast We Can See His Wife Vaishu, His Coach, His Boss And His Senior Players. Completely Outstanding. Ending Was Goosebumps!

The only thing I knew was that he had played IPL with the Rajasthan Royals team.But after watching this movie came to know about his life, his struggle, passion, and determination towards cricket
This movie is a biopic of the cricketer Praveen Tambe covering two journeys , one, his journey from the small tournaments to the big stage IPL and Ranji and two, his journey from being a medium pacer to a leg spinner.His only aim was to play for the Ranji trophy.It is a very inspiring story and a well-made biopic.This man kept fighting till he got a chance to play IPL first and then Ranji. He did odd jobs and practiced every day. Played all sorts of gully tournaments, corporate matches, and all.He was rejected so many times, mainly because of his age, luck, etc, but he never gave up and chased his dreams until it was fulfilled.Shreyas Talpade, as Praveen Tambe, gets to show his superb talent. He is brilliant in the movie.Parambrta chaterjee as reporter and Ashish vidyarthi as coach supported well in the film.A simple biopic film with a wonderful cast.If you love cricket, then you must watch this inspiring story .

Casting is excellent, Shreyas lived the character. Anjali role is so important and she lived it at the best to showcase what Pravin has gone through from her perspective. Most of the biopic has the cinematic events to add spice to the story and I'm very glad that the elements in this movie is very subtle and doesn't disturbs or disrupts the pace of the movie. Thanks for the entire team for providing us an opportunity to watch WHO is Pravin Tambe?

Hats of to the team who bought thought that this story has to be told. The casting was spot on. Mr. Shreyas Talpade is the heartbeat of the movie. No one, I mean no one could have pulled off this role so beautifully. What a dedication that he has shown. As pointed out by many people who have wrote the review, this should have been released in theatres. This movie is a gem. But not sure many people will know about this movie. I will try to spread positive words as much I can. It is a privilege to witness the story of a person who never gave up on his dreams. Shreyas Sir, yeh jadoo aap hi kar sakte ho aur koi nahin. Thank again to the entire crew who believed in story.

Glad that some one had the courage to pick up the story and make a movie in the world where we need to only well known success stories instead of truly inspiring one's.Glad the narration and quality of the movie is equally good and nothing less compared to our sports theme based movies like 83, MS Dhoni, Chak De India, Bhag Milka Bhag or even Dangal. Shreyas Talapde has provided yet another classic performance to match the need.All in all a wonderful script, delivered very well.

saurabhkhullar-97134,3 April 2022,Bang on budget,"Biopics are risky experiments and the game is always 50/50 in India and that is when we have big star cast players,Like the real life Pravin Tambe I am predicting that this movie might pull out a rabbit from the hat. The story telling gets a little slow towards the middle but overall the movie might be a morale booster for many going through hard times.Also I personally feel releasing it on OTT only was a job well done.

Every player struggles but even successful players give up after some time but it really requires a great amount of dedication,confidence and self belief to keep playing that too cricket in a country like India where you are shunted by the society if you score less marks in normal higher secondary school ...imagine the shunting, demotivating talk, family and society pressure to keep continuing at that age . Pravin Tambe is an exceptional and the movie depicts a good version but not the complete struggle. Shreyas did a wonderful job and is a very good choice he keeps the rhythm of the movie.

Pravin tambe played by shreyas talpade was awsm. Its milestone in indian cinema which shows you can do far better even if u hv low budget and the only thing u require is a good honest story and crew. Its an also a open challenge to main stream bollywood cinema tht pls change ur attitude towards originality.

There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie.

Prashanth Neel kept his words and wrote such a Marvellous script. Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie. Better I recommend them to watch love story/ Family Sentiment movies rather than Action Movies like KGF Chapter 2.Ps: The spoiler is Achyuth Kumar, who played the role of Gurupandian is the main Antagonist, not Sanjay Dutt.",10/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
Prashast_Singh,15 April 2022,Expectations surpassed!,"""Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet."" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.",10/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
amrutpanchal,29 April 2022,"Most Honest Review:: Over The Top, Over Dramatic and Overrated!!","KGF was the most awaited movie after the success of 1st chapter and the sequel is getting way better response. But when I compare to many other south action/drama flicks it is over the top in all areas. Acting is average, direction is avg, screenplay average and story is basically inspired by many other movies like Scarface, Agneepath etc etc. The only thing I liked about this movie is music and BGM. And for this only reason you can watch it in the cinema halls.

saikatsamanta,24 April 2022,A Sequel well made but Couldn't reach the Greatness of the First One,"The Most Anticipated Sequel after Bahubali delivers on a lot of fronts, but misses on a few too. The film starts right from where the first film ended, Rocky taking over KGF & all of his adversaries rushing in to claim their stakes. Instead of the relentless action in the first film, this time you get political & strategic plays, with both sides taking wins & losses. The dialogues are great once again, Performances from Yash, Sanjay Dutt & Raveena Tandon were superb. Great Cinematography & Music that evokes the emotions. The romantic angle is better in this one & the great emotional bond of Mother & Son is once again central to the plot. But there are big issues in screenplay & editing. Instead of the streamlined story of the first film, this one stretches in so many directions & it becomes really tough to keep up with it. A lot of scenes abruptly end & I expected the ending to be much more powerful. A great effort but ultimately falls short of expectations.

arungeorge13,6 May 2022,"An improvement over the original in the technical aspects, but not the writing! [+53%]","K. G. F: Chapter 2 is a film that purely runs on technical finesse. There are impressively staged set-pieces, sophisticated production design, a pan-Indian (and possibly international) plot setup, and thumping background score. But the writing, something that didn't work for me in Chapter 1, is still very superficial. In Chapter 2, Rocky (Yash, with commanding screen presence) is no longer an underdog. He has already achieved legendary levels of notoriety with his deeds, even attracting the attention of the nation's Prime Minister. Prashanth Neel is great at crafting mass moments one after the other, in quick succession. The film, as a whole, is a carefully designed collection of mass moments - with frequent interludes of mother-son sentiment and a drab romance.In my review for Chapter 1, I'd hoped to see Srinidhi Shetty get at least a decent arc but alas, it's even worse than the first. Not only is she deemed mere entertainment for the protagonist, her only task in the film is to say the three magical words to the guy who's been holding her captive (Stockholm Syndrome max?). Okay, I get it. My bad to even think she'd have anything worthwhile to do in the film other than ""spoilers: die while pregnant"". The mother-son flashbacks are as weird as they can get - she whines and delivers a whole massy sermon to hospital personnel when her son is battling for life. I couldn't even buy the reason for Rocky's excessive greed - it's an attempt at painting him grey alright, but it's not written well. Neel shouldn't ever attempt family dramas or rom-coms. Like, ever.Sanjay Dutt's Adheera has got the look for sure, but the nature of his character is so utterly generic that he fails to rise above Chapter 1's Garuda. Raveena Tandon's PM Ramika Sen should have been the film's trump card, but the whole angle around her is played in the safest possible manner, giving Rocky a few more instances of elevation. The mass film tropes are scattered all over the place. But if you need a filmmaker to inventively visualize your action, Neel is the man you should call. Maybe, he can make a full-blown actioner (where the core focus is just on the action) without the build-ups, the monologues, or the exaggerated sentiments. I'd definitely buy a ticket to that film!",5/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
ssscvrce,19 April 2022,Overrated,"KGF 2
is overrated. Only Sanjay Dutt made it look like a real gangster movie, rest everything was in slow motion, too much heroic shots for the hero, the biggest drawback of South Indian movies. Also didn't connect with the hype that kgf has the deepest secret in chapter two.

Chapter 2 lacks good story, action scenes were average with mostly gun fights, climax was just OK. Garuda was so fierce in chapter 1 and was a perfect villian but that was missing with dutt.The flashback scenes with mother was totally not needed especially in climax where infant rocky was suffering from pneumonia but his mother is giving long speeches to doctors just because they asked why she bought him in rain.Reena as said by rocky at the beginning is just for entertainment.The funny thing is rocky goes alone to the enemy place, police station and the bodyguards of enemies instead of shooting him just get scared.

cs_rahul_kumar,15 April 2022,KGF - Chapter 2 is The Super-Duper Blockbuster Movie of 2022 !!!,"KGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.",10/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

I mean if they are presenting the hero to be a superhuman, then it makes sense. I'm not going to talk about the dialogues...not worth mentioning. I hope Indian cinema will not be know only for these kind of movies. All the dialogues just serve one purpose that is to praise the hero of the movie.

nidhunmoviebuff,14 April 2022,The perfect mass masala superstar vehicle!,"OMG. What did I just watch! KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film's success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.We rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic ""Garuda"" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda's vengeful uncle ""Adheera"" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India ""Ravika"" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash's sheer swag and star power.The void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as ""Vanaram"", Harish Rai as ""Khasim"", Achyuth Kumar as ""Guru Pandian"" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky ""office assistant"". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai's love interest ""Reena"", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.Prashant Neel's ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai's childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.Prashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash's natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer's strengths. While Neel uses Dutt's eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India's Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.And what can I say about Yash that hasn't been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of ""Sulthana"" to the emotionally wrought ""Thannane"".""KGF Chapter 2"" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like ""Pushpa (2021)"" and ""RRR (2022)"" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don't forget to catch the post-credits scene!",8/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
thujan,28 April 2022,Lack of story and the whole movie felt like a BGM,"Loved Chapter 1 as it seemed different from a regular commercial masala movie and narrated by a third person view. However, chapter 2 seems to have over done it and fallen into the typical masala movie. Very poor editing, especially the car sequence. Sound mixing was very poorly done. I can safely say that once the hype is done people will realize how bad of a movie it was.

YourBossHere-00,18 April 2022,What's more overrated than this movie ? Nothing.,Finally decided to watch the second part after all the hype even after finding first part to be just average. Thought the director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong it's worse now.The movie starts with the entry of our Rocking Star Yash with a BGM and they Forgotted to off that BGM throught the film. BGM plays on throughout the whole movie yeah it's good but after one points it's just unbearable and can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is a BGM. Then the film proceeds to have 20 more entry scenes of Yash till the end of the movie. Everyone comes praises Rocky then disappear oh gosh. The second half bores you in place of being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously don't care about. The romance seems very forced just to make Rocky Bhai furious enough to kill Adheera.The action sequences are just as poorly edited as the first part the most awkward is the car chase scene where it continuously blacks out for no reason dude show it clearly it's a action movie after all. The action in other parts is also medicore and again fast paced with many cuts. The supporting actors are there just for the sake of it. Sanjay Dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time and no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by Rocky Bhai easily. Raveena is decent in her role but again not much importance given to her . Plus the movie is filled with many absurd scenes which don't make any sense.Overall the second part is even worse than first and only cinematography can't save a bad film infact i founded the first part to have better colours and better frames than this. How are people calling this mess a masterpiece is beyond my understanding. It's just too much to take. Chapter 3 is also coming which I'm not even tiny bit interested about after this movie's experience.,1/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
sac77,27 April 2022,A 'mass' movie for low IQ people.,"I am from South India and I am used to a lot of so-called 'mass commercial' movies which have a ton of illogical heroism and gravity-defying fights which I really hate. The thing that set apart KGF 1 from those sorts of movies was the fact that the movie made sense and it did not really feel out of the world.I cannot say the same with KGF 2. It was so disappointing. The movie is nothing but hero worship throughout the span of the movie.Some scenes of this movie did not make any sense at all, they assumed that the viewers are of low IQ and not able to reason whatever they show in the movie.Some scenes like the hero using a helicopter as a fan for the heroine were so cringe! (BTW, who in the world dries pappad in front of a Bungalow!). Then there was this scene when the villain asks the doctor retrieving bullets from his body to keep a metal piece in his body to feel the pain! Bruh!The hero worship even goes to the baby hero! There is a scene towards the end of the movie when the hero's mom takes a baby hero to a hospital with pneumonia. The doctor instructs her to take the child to a better hospital in the city, to which she responds with some heroic dialogue as if it is a super baby! It was so cringy.The heroine character is useless in this movie. Just for the sake of the tradition of Indian movies that there should be a heroine! There is no use for her in the storyline at all, both in KGF 1 and 2! When the villain killed her, I was actually glad that I do not have to see her cringe scenes again!After the villain is killed in the movie, the hero's enemy is the Government of India. They made it look like India is some third-world country with a clownish military! Beyond this point, the hero himself was acting more like a terrorist and I really would have felt better if he was killed! Because he was led by nothing but selfishness to keep the so-called 'promise' he gave to his late mom! He becomes akin to the villain of KGF 1. He does not care about the people who work under him and constantly pushes them to dig more and more gold!There is a scene where the mentor of the hero questions him about the purpose of what he is doing and how he is any different from Garuda. (KGF 1 villain). The response from the hero is something lame inline of the promise he has to keep and for that he will do whatever it takes! All of a sudden, everyone's mind is changed and they are Ok with whatever he is doing!Some other things which I noted are that everyone has a gun in the movie unless and until there is a fight with the hero. In that case, they will come running with some knives and axes! And the hero conveniently takes one of them and stabs everyone else to death!The BGM used in this movie was nowhere near KGF 1 and I never felt any goosebumps! BGM was not cleverly used in this movie.The much-discussed black screens during some shots also felt really weird!Whatsoever, the movie has grossed some 1000 Crores or more and it shows how a movie does not have to be really good or logical to be a blockbuster. It only has to please the majority. These sorts of movies are generally meant for the low IQ audience and children who doesn't question the logic behind the scenes and the storyline. And it has worked.Whoever sharing any opinions against this movie are being canceled here in India and being called an anti-national!",1/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

saifur-rey,3 June 2022,Overhyped movie,"Couldn't find any reason why there is a over 8 rating for this movie. Yash over acts with lots of cringe dialogues. There is just too many illiterates among the indian crowds who like this sort of movies without any good plot or acting, they just see the VFX and big budget movie think of it as something extra ordinary. Just felt like vomiting yuck.

SoumikBanerjee25,17 April 2022,"In terms of Pure Charisma, there's nobody like Yash, he is something else!","The people who fell in love with the first chapter, I can safely say that they are in for an absolute delight. It's bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it's nothing but an Action Junky's dream come true.Regardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn't fully sold on it.Halt the hate train and just let me clarify...I have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as ""Adheera"". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.Now when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don't get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it's just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.For Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It's her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she's fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.Looking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don't get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!I'm telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it's truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense.",8/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

winak,7 May 2022,1 dimensional movie !!!,"Nearly 1/2 the movie is dedicated to building up this Rocky character. I bet Salman Khan must be scrambling to get a producer to make a movie on similar lines. It's the kind of ego massaging movies he relies on. Back to the movie. Unlike Bahubali I did not connect with this movie primarily because the Hindi dubbing and dialogues was of low quality. The sephia look made the movie drab. Sanjay Dutt borrowed his look from the Vikings tv series and had moments of Agneepath's Kancha Cheena in him. Raveena Tandon as PM was decent, I feel Vidya Balan would have been better. Yash in the main role, didn't have to over extend himself in the department of acting or expression cause all throughout it was the same with minute variations. Cockiness made relating with the character difficult. So if you an impressionable person this movie might appeal to your senses, as for me I dont understand what all the hullabaloo is about.

Only adrenaline junkies would like this movie. Loud background music gave me a headache. It's not art. It's business that has profited by exploiting low IQ teenage emotions by showing romance and action. Most of the things were predictable in the movie ergo no mystery.

Umeshsonii,18 April 2022,Chapter 1 was better! (Just my opinion),"Personally, I enjoyed chapter 1 more than this chapter, because of the suspense they created and the planning to kill garuda and the way the hero kills garuda alone. That's just entirely on a different level. Admiral was also a good villain but the fight was normal as we expect from south Indian cinema.No hate! Just my review.

swatibcharan,19 April 2022,Buildup for nothing.,"The movie was entertaining but the story went downhill in comparison to chapter 1. There are easily avoidable plot holes. Even if we talk about the movie as an individual it still has a lot of mistakes. The action sequences were ridiculously long and poorly choreographed. The visual effects are extremely bad that movie from 2005 had better effects. Does not seem like a high budget movie and definitely not worth the hype it gets or a theatrical watch.The money it is making seems like a joke from desperate Indian audience.

Coming to mass scenes, although most of them did not land well for me..Rocky's entry, return etc where top notch scenes which are not to be missed.Length is the biggest factor that drags the movie back.

sumanthgenz,28 April 2022,Grander but hollower than Chapter 1,"Huge fan of Chapter 1, which had much more direct plot and gave Rocky a good character arc, while still making him appear like a very cunning, gray character. Chapter 2 has a fast-paced screenplay too, but it collapses under the weight of all the characters and story that has to be packed in. Rocky doesn't have very much room to grow as a character and is overall just a vessel to deliver elevation scenes. However, in Chapter 2 the elevation scenes don't land nearly as well as the movie lacks the emotional depth of the first. When the screenplay is shifting from place to place quickly and rushing through plot points, there is not much room to setup stakes and emotional payoff, which is this film rings hollower than Chapter 1. Chapter 1's first half is basically how all of Chapter 2 plays out, except the novelty of style and new characters from Chapter 1 is gone since Chapter 2 is the sequel.This movie has 3 very powerful villains on paper, but Adheera and Inayat Khalil are underwhelming on screen. Ramika Sen is a good adversary to Rocky, but comes a bit too late in the story. Even though Garuda never met or fought Rocky in Chapter 1, he was mounted as a much scarier villains than the antagonists in Chapter 2.Also, surprisingly KGF 2 is light on action, especially in the first half, as Rocky is not fighting as much anymore. That being said, the scale of the action, the cinematography and overall stakes are better in Chapter 2. The ending if somewhat predictable, but it is nice that the narrators of Chapter 2 add more mystery to the how real Rocky's mythos is, which makes Chapter 2 a little more interesting in that regard.Chapter 1 built a great platform for Chapter 2, but Chapter 2 does not concern itself with delivering on the massive hype for its 3 villains, further developing Rocky's character or raising the emotional stakes. Chapter 2 is instead more of a machine that connects cool set pieces, which are working wonders with mass audiences, but are underwhelming to audiences that connected more deeply with Chapter 1. KGF 2 is better than a fair share of movies, and its success worldwide is also commendable. I just wish it was better.",5/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
grarunkumar1994,14 April 2022,Rocky UNLEASHED,"KGF Chapter 2 is bigger, bolder, better and densely packed engaging screenplay and ofcourse dialogues that elevate emotions.Especially considering it as a genre of Indian action film for the masses, this film not just surpasses expectations in quality of writing and making. It in itself sets a benchmark far beyond anything seen before.The soundtrack is phenomenal and aids in conveying the apt emotions at the right time esp the switch of soundtracks between violent action scenes and the mother-son flashbacks.Action scenes is as good if nt better than prequel.Essentially KGF is the story of an ambitious strong mother and a fierce son determined enough to defeat the world to keep his promise to her.One of the finest well made action films in world cinema.",10/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

tkmce2008,18 April 2022,A massive improvement over it's predecessor but still jarring & loud,"My ears are still ringing after sitting through 168 minutes of extremely loud & jarring background score. But I must admit the sequel to the ultra-stylish KGF is far better than its predecessor. And we all how bad sequels usually turn out to be. To be honest, I didn't like the first movie even one bit. But Chapter 2, I didn't mind sitting through.Chapter 2 picks up right after the events of Chapter 1. Rocky is now the undisputed king of KGF. But this position comes with its share of enemies and that include the Viking inspired, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt); Prime Minister, Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) among others.KGF has its downsides. First and foremost is the jarring BGM, which literally numbs you for a while post-movie. Then comes the poor shooting skills: despite all the arms training, Rocky's men cannot hit a
target. Adheera is standing front and centre; all his men get shot but Adheera gets shot once on his shoulder (a beautifully shot scene nevertheless). Rocky also sets up the biggest fan for his lady love - using helicopter blades.But Chapter 2 is better in terms of its pacing. After all the setup done in the first, the sequel makes more sense. The stakes are higher, the action set pieces are more extravagant. The 19-year old editor, Ujwal Kulkarni does a very good job. Rocking Star, Yash is as flamboyant as ever. Raveena R Tandon & Sanjay Dutt are good. Prakash Raj replaces Anant Nag as the narrator (maybe they wanted a bigger star in this role). Female lead Srinidhi Shetty doesn't have much to do & her Stockholm Syndrome track doesn't bode too well.Chapter 2 may cause irreversible damage to your ear drums but it is definitely a step up from the first. The final sequence on the ship seemed a bit anticlimactic and the announcement of Chapter 3 was totally unnecessary (better if they end on a high) but go for it if you love mass-y films. Rocking Star Yash's 8 years of hardwork and beard maintenance has paid off.P. S. Find a theatre that is running the Kannada (original version) with Subtitles. Watching it in another language won't give you the full experience.",6/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2
Couziambatman,14 April 2022,Goosebumps.!,"First of all its never easy to make a sequel to a movie that too which had such a hybe behind it, but the director have done it with style . Havnt seen a movie which gave goosebumps from the start till end like this after KGF part 1 ironically. Its all style over substance but it aint bad at what it does. Have some minor set backs which can be easily ignored when looked at the bigger picture.

ridi-arahan,18 April 2022,What does not kill you makes you a bigger achiever .,"What worked:
One of the challenges while making the movie to make the viewers relate and convince them that the story is engaging. This movie is a winner for that matter. The movie is bigger, better and interesting, and even more engaging that the first chapter. The lead characters are commendable in their role. Sanjay Dhatt and Raveena were well introduced in their roles, added the needed spice and interest in the movie. It's amazing that a movie with this budget could hold the scale and execution in such a believable and engaging story. The narrative is well written , characters well acted, well edited, scored, mixed and produced. The movie with the budget could pull a production and execution makes a case study for the film makers as to how to execute and narrate the story. And for that matter director deserves the praise for keeping all the departments well balanced in their respective roles as a film makers. I am sure the film makers across are watching the movie with an awe and an opportunity to research how to make a movie with the scale, execution, acting and overall making of the movie. We have been hearing about a young and bright editor of the movie . I am sure everyone has an eye on him after this movie. The movie excites and eagers us for the next chapter of the great combo of Yash and Prashant's next venture, and we can say the movie is a benchmark and path breaker for the Indian movie industry to learn what can be achieved with the right vision and execution as the movie has rare dull moments but lots of punchlines and treats that keeps the jaws dropping for most parts of the movie
What did not work:
Very few scenes come to my head as what can and needs to be changed in this movie, making it better than the first chapter. Maybe the love song could have been shortened like other songs but hey who am I to say since the movie works overall for the most part which is quiet rare. So, even with plot holes, if any, movie works big time for the viewers to enjoy the ride.Final verdict: highly recommended.",9/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

lotekguy-1,6 June 2022,Huuuuge sequel dropoff despite massive budget,"KGF Chapter 1 was a bit muddled in parts, but offered a satisfying saga of a poor orphan who rose high in the criminal realm, but NEVER lost sight of his concern for the underclass, leading a slave revolt against overwhelming evil and power. He was a bad guy who was really good, making his ass-kicking scenes gratifying to watch.In this sequel, Rocky is far less sympathetic as the dude with the power, and the plot is hard to follow with so many trying to oust him in so many ways for so many reasons. The ending is all hyperbole without substance. Very disappointing.

kirankumarfrank,14 April 2022,160 minutes of Class!,"Rocky Bhai does it again. Adrenaline rush and goosebumps through out the movie. All the costumes we so good. Wish all the suits that rocky wore fit perfectly someday on me too ;). Sanjay dutt did a commendable job and they embraced the Vikings reference! Production design is out of this world and can be compared to few of the Hollywood movies. Cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is also very good! BGM is always in perfect sync! The romance angle was bit forced, cringy and sometimes it crosses the line (the entertainment dialogue, the only dialogue which didn't get any whistle from the audience!). But speaking of entertainment, if you want a entertaining movie packed with well choreographed action, go watch it on theater soon and don't wait for OTT release.

sujanfaster,15 April 2022,Kannada Cinema in all its Glory,"The ambition of the movie KGF is kind of like its lead character Rocky Bhai which is to conquer whatever is possible. Chapter 1 not only made sure Kannada movie industry on the map, but also led to the start of filmmakers taking pan India releases seriously. This was just because of the sheer quality of dubbing, right partnerships and promotion efforts while releasing in other languages. Finally, when KGF Chapter 2 is hitting the screens 3.5 years after its predecessor the cinema lovers across India also across some parts of the world have embraced it with love. KGF is complex and detailed filmmaking at its best for a gangster action drama. Director Prashant Neel's attention to detail is what makes it stand out from the rest of action/drama movies. With only 3 films under his belt in the last 8 years, it looks like he has already established his brand of filmmaking.While the first part showed us the rise of Rocky bhai after dethroning Garuda in KGF, the plot of the second part is slightly more complex and political. Chapter 2's narration is almost like a biopic of an actual gangster (or should I say monster :P). The movie keeps you hooked frame by frame and almost makes you feel a part of the world of KGF. Cinematography, art direction and the background score elevate almost every scene to a different level. Adheera's introduction scene involving his entry into Rocky's territory starts literally by ""burning bridges"". This is just a sample of many cleverly executed scenes throughout the movie.The dark sepia kind of tone with barely any colourful visuals perfectly suits director's narrative. The action sequences have been executed and edited more like art and haven't gone unnecessarily over the top. One of the fight scenes which is barely relevant to the plot still makes for a great watch just because of the background narration and the camerawork. The dialogue writing continues to impress, and it is one of the best I have seen in Kannada cinema in my lifetime. The songs may seem like almost a continuation of part 1 music, but the visual treatment of them makes you hum and cheer along. There is a brilliant mini recreation of part 1 in the song 'Toofan' and it is probably one of the best example of Neel's genius execution.The KGF franchise has focused a lot on each and individual characters. Irrespective of how big/small the role is almost each of them gets a narration and introduction of their own. This turns out to be both a blessing and a curse, especially in this movie. The character arc for some roles turns out to be slightly abrupt, but I guess it is the sacrifice director must make for the optimal running time. This does not affect Rocky Bhai's character and the evolution from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 is handled seamlessly. Yash's dialogue delivery as Rocky will forever be a trademark of its own. Almost every line of Rocky bhai's character is a punch dialogue and Yash delivers them all in style without seeming to be jarring. He brings shades of Al Pacino from Scarface at times. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera has a great screen presence as an antagonist but somehow his character lacks a strong conflict with the lead and a detailed backstory to establish his purpose better. Srinidhi Shetty does get a longer screen time and she does more than a decent job with very few lines. Her character towards the end turns out to be a bit too mainstream and I believe that was planned by the director keeping a certain section of the audience in mind. Prashant Neel has very cleverly handled Raveena Tandon's dubbing and has not tried to force her lip sync in Kannada. This also serves the purpose of her being in Delhi as the Prime Minister. All other supporting characters contribute their bit to movie's elevating moments. Harish Rai as Chacha is a very well written old school supporting character and hats off to the director for creating a right mix of veteran and new age Kannada movie actors.KGF Chapter 2 is more than just a mass entertainer. It is the perfect artistic execution of the story of a movie and credit has to be given to all its departments. It is an event to witness in one's lifetime and if you are a Kannadiga, you'd be walking out of the theatre beaming with pride.",9/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

Biswas_,16 April 2022,"Definitely over the top, but can be excused!","HONEST REVIEW FROM A NOT A FAN OF YASH!Just like KGF 1, KGF 2 is also extremely over the top so if you were a fan of KGF before , then only choose this film. Just don't go watch KGF 2 just because of the hype and stuff, watch KGF 1 first..see if you liked it then go for 2nd part as this film caters mostly to young audience and die hard fans of masala films.KGF 2 can be easily excused for its over the top nature solely because of some terrific performances and interesting story telling. It is exactly the same storytelling like KGF 1 but director Neel takes it one step above. It is this interesting storytelling that held my attention in part 1 and even now in part 2.The BGM is just earthquake inducing ..it's extremely loud but it's so electrifying that it elevates any scene where Yash would be present. I personally enjoyed the BGM. Dialogues are again those typical chest thumping ones from what you expect from South India. But they are hard hitting and good to hear. Especially from Yash's mother.Filled with tons of whistle/clap worthy scenes be it Yash or Sanju baba both have got some terrific dialogues that induce whistles.Performances. Everyone has done a fantastic job be it the lead or the side actors .Cinematography and setting of this film is just top class. Definitely you can feel the green screen background at places but whats in front of that green screen is just mesmerizing. Rustic and raw looking . The mines are so well set that grayish tone and everything gives that rustic look. Highly impressed.Climax battle is a treat. All hell break loose. That final battle felt like I was watching some battle from some kingdom film where two kings from two kingdoms are fighting. Absolute treat for masala lovers. Fires coming out as Adheera and Rocky proceed to clash is just extraordinary to watch. Full value for money scene.Negatives - a section no 10/10 reviewer would tell you but I'll highlight them. 1. Stretched ending 2. Some hilarious fight sequences. I am not a die hard fan of any south film so when I see such action, it definitely looks super exciting but at the same time definitely makes me laugh at least once. 3. An absolute not needed romantic song in the 2nd half that Unnecessarily increases the length of the film further which already is stretched at the end. 4. In 1st half there is a car chase sequence (that imo looked exactly like the one from the climax of Race 3 lol) . The way it is shot, in start-stop manner , didnt like it. Would have enjoyed a full sequence rather than that start-stop fashion . Also, wait, wait. There is a scene at the very last related to Rocky it looked exactly inspired from James Bond : no time to die ending sequence.Overall, if you are a die hard masala film fan or even if you loved KGF 1, then you cannot miss KGF 2. You pay 200rs or 1700rs for the most expensive cinema, you will feel totally satisfied.PS - I don't glorify/ celebrate films like these.",8/10,K.G.F: Chapter 2

vivtiwari-31566,2 May 2022,Disappointed,"Disappointed to see, no where the movie is able to engage, director seems to be in hurry. KGF 1 had the struggle of hero for himself and oppressed people which involved viewers emotionally and this complimented by awesome music. These factors are are completely missing here. The movie is not able engage, it turns out to be just another masala movie.

harishnj,14 April 2022,Rocky's world of KGF,"KGF Chapter 2 had connected well to where its predecessor left off. The world of KGF in the film was brilliant, stunning and epic. The background score was terrific through out the film. The direction and screenplay at its best. And the amount of hard work done on each and every frame is clearly visible.

meetjoy,2 May 2022,Very badly overrated 0 acting skill movie.,"And the award goes to Yash's hairstylist and wardrobe professional as in the entire movie he keeps flaunting his hair and suit. There is no acting or action what so ever. There was no context to why everybody was worshipping him although all were staying as labourers working day in and out and he kept staying in huge palace. Poor storyline and acting coupled with very loud and noisy background music makes it one of the worst movie. The action sequence has nothing to boast of. Watch it at your own risk.

coolboy-87738,14 May 2022,Overrated movie,"Same old cliche, violence without purpose.Highly overrated movie. Just because movie is not from Bollywood it doesn't mean this movie is automatically good. People like it due to herd mentality of Indians!Story is not that good!
